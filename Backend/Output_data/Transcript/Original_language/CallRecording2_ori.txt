I don't know what you said. I don't know what you said. I'm sorry. I'm going to start now. Yes. It's starting from the 11th century, right? I don't know. I don't know. I was just writing a book. I sent a script. 5th sem or 7th sem. 15th sem start. Yes. But I don't know what you said. What you said, how did you take it? I don't know. I'm listening to you. I'm talking to you. Yes. What do you say? When will the end start? July end. When? July end. Yes. I don't know. You'll have a little time. There will be a little time. But it's not coming. We don't know what you said. What do you say? I don't know what you said. I'm not doing this. I'm not doing this. We don't want to do it. I don't want to do it. I'm not doing it. We should not do it. We don't want to do it. Don't let it do it. We are using the session. We will be a bad person. We will go down. But we don't want to do it. We are looking at the data from the data, but we didn't start to get started. We didn't have anything to say. We left the code of the code. We didn't have any graph or binary tree, e3, u3, we didn't have any question. Where will you come from? We don't know. We don't know anything. I don't know anything. That's the problem. We have done anything. We don't know anything. We don't know anything. We have data related to data analysis. We are all doing that. We are working on cloud, so we are running more and we also get salary. How do we program it? Yeah, we are crazy. We don't know anything. We are not doing it. But what do we do? We have to do it. We have to stop it. We start with data. We don't want to go. We will go after it. Data analysis. We don't want to go after it. We don't want to go after it. We don't want to go after it. We will go after it. We will go after it. We will start after it. Three people are coming. We will come after it. No problem. No problem. No problem. No problem. No problem. No problem. No problem. No problem. No problem. We are coming to the hospital. We will come after 2-3 people. But we will not come. You are coming now. Do you call for 30? Yeah. If it is late, then I will give you 1 more than that. I will see you later. The month is starting. Yes. I don't think there is anything else. I've studied and studied. I'm going to go to festival now. I'm going to go to the house. There are children. Everyone has their vacation. There are children from all places. It's not my fault. I'm going to go to the house. I'm going to go to the house. I'm going to work on Netflix. I'm going to play some other movies. I'm going to play some other movies. That is my fault. Why? My fault is my fault. I'm watching this video. I'm watching this video. I'm watching this video. When I was doing this video, I was just doing this video. My body was just like to go to the house. I've got a sense of feeling this video. If we're watching this video, then we'll see this video. We have also done the course, but we have also done the same thing. I have also done one course. No, the course was done yesterday. We have done the data analyst, the Google data analyst. It's done. Did you get the certification? Yes, I got the certification. I gave Capstone project, so the situation is bad. What happened? Capstone project. What did you say? I gave you a data set. There's a 15-20 data set. And we don't understand which data set we have. And how do we suggest what new product or new features we should add? It's a lot of money. So we think that we set our boundaries first. We will put the assumption link. So we will do that. We have a whole data set. It's 18-20, 15-20 data set. It's 18-20. We will analyze all of them. We will analyze all of them. What is the work? I don't know. I don't know how much. I don't know how much. I don't know how much. I don't know how much. I don't know how much. I have multiple data sets. I did SQL. I have data science. I have done SQL. I have done R. I have done R. I have done R. I have done R. You have done data analysis. You have done R. I have done R. I have done R. I have done R. There is a advantage that is very large. That is the visualization of that. which learn the topic that I was Vasu has written in problem statement on it. that she said you are trying to work on collaboration. Applause? means what? Arriter. you are the job. Because you will be able to collaborate. How much more ? Are you able to do recruits here without addition? But it's not the software level. Because it will look like there is a lot of data set. didn't you get under llama I don't know what the problem is about XR. If it is high-end PC, it will crash the data set. Yes, it will crash, but it will not use it. It's a unique option. SQL will not always use it. Sometimes it doesn't have visualization. If it is different, if it is different, if it is different, if it is different, if it is different, then we will do that. And SQL syntax is also very helpful. My SQL, I was in course, I had given SQL. I also had SQL data set. I also had spreadsheet, SQL and table. I also had three. There was R. No, my example has been a flask. What do you say now? What's the name? SQL, MySQL, SQL lite, dash, dash, Okay. I have dashed. I have dashed. Yes, SQL, BigQuery, we are still running. We are still running. SQL is still running. Then we know that it is paid version. We can insert or delete it. So, we have to use Microsoft MySQL server. MySQL server. It is running after that. But, MySQL server is also paid. It is not paid. It is not paid. It is free. What is mySQL server? MySQL is free. MySQL is free. MySQL is free. MySQL is free. Microsoft's is free. MySQL is free. Yes, Food is free. But, our syntax sets are free. Yes. And, Doesn't come think. used to be accessible because they are free. MySQL server is free. And, tam口 data are free. Bothata� crowds are free. PARKred just I have done SQL, I have done SQL complete advanced level, I have done it with honors. I have done it with honors. I have done it with advanced, professional, subquery and table creation. I have created, auditor, delete, subquery, transactions. We don't understand all queries. And table create is very complicated. All queries are in query, and then the query is in the same way. I don't understand SQL. No, I don't understand all queries. You clearly understand all queries. You have to do all queries. We will do all queries. We will do all queries. Because it is not my query. I have all subquery, joins. Yes, joins query. I have all transactions. I have all transactions, callbacks, returns. I have all transactions. Wow, Prima. So, then you will come back. Okay. Yes, I have all of them in SQL. In the name of SQL. In the name of data visualization, Matplotly, Flask, Plotly, C-Bond, Dash, all have been created. In Python, we have done data visualization. But if R has not done, it is so small, it is so small. It is true. We are interested in R. We are interested in R. My syntax is so much. It doesn't make money. It doesn't make money. It's possible. It's possible. R is powerful. It's possible. But R is powerful. It doesn't make money. It doesn't make money. You are saying that. But we don't have any questions. No, it doesn't make money. But now, I think that has been difficult. Anyway, I just don't want to take power anymore. Everything has really éc Finished. If Rabbis has not done that, we can honestly do that. We will also take power in the 10th graders. Billy? Yes. If you are just doing good and Marta experienced fear. Gimme more at Ar Living in Python, you like recess. Possibly. If you need to do one certificate, you don't have to do one certificate. You don't have to do it. I have one of my ego courses left. I have to do it. I will do it. My total was 8 courses. My total was 10 courses. We will have 9 courses in the past. We will have 10 courses in the past. Okay. IBM was the one? Yes, IBM was the one. It was made in detail. Oh, very much. I am very upset. Actually, it is true. IBM made a whole detail. Google made two things. One made an advanced data analytics and a good data analytics. But my setting vision is written. Yes, but it is intermediate level. Advanced level is starting. Yes, that is. You will have to do it. Yes, we are checking. We are checking. We are saying. We are thinking about analysis. Yes, this field is very good. Very good. But it is. Data analytics is good. It is not right to VMware. What does Google make it? It is not developed for you. There is a new setup. There is something good for you. But than that, Aud set is giving. There is still time foramine. The defense must not rely on drugs. Things could talk about. Things could Like this, it is you don't need anything. Yaar me. forsake my own problem. Just leave from the day, it takes the difference to make süss matters. Or not problem with more than the fact there are two based up of data Cartman. There is a minimum requirement That you do so much, that is sufficient. It doesn't happen. You keep doing it, keep doing it. There is no boundary. You don't have to do it. You have to do it. You have done the whole data structure? You will see two days later, you will have to do it. That's why I thought you did it. 15 years ago, you had to ask me. You asked me to ask me, I asked you to ask me, I didn't ask me any questions. I didn't ask any questions. What was that? I didn't ask any questions. I got all the answers. No, I'm not asking you. Yes, it is. I'm not asking you. I'm asking you to ask me or ask me to ask you. I'm asking you to ask me. I'm not asking you. I'm asking you. I'm asking you. If you ask me to ask me, I'm asking you. And if you do it with DA, then you will start with graph. We won't do it with track. You won't do it with track. One time, you will do it with the data structure. I think it's very bad. We will do it with the last. I mean, I mean, almost good. Linkless, stack, queue, all are bad. Oh, then I have a question. Implement linkless using stack. Implement linkless using queue. Oh, what? What is that? What do you need to do with stack? How arerente-e- potato? It is study 18. This I need to read before. so it's very good. You can do something to do. Very good. So, what? Polinomials. It turns until all of this ... yes. It two I think that the data analytics question is that I can read it. That's the case. I think that it will be better. Data analytics, you think that we can visualize it. We can think about it. What is happening? It doesn't happen. No. It doesn't happen. It doesn't happen. It's like putting money on the soap. I'm saying, I'm going to give it a gift. Where are you? We don't have any questions. Every time it happens, we see that it's not my sense. No. That's right. One or two times it happens. It doesn't happen. The data is done. Then it happens. Then it happens. I think it's not my sense. I think it's not my sense. It's not my sense. Why are you so much? Where are you sitting at 4 hours? This is the question. Data analytics, you see, if there's any outcome, then you can understand it. Yes. There's something that comes from there. The outcome. Yes. There's something that comes from there. There's not a desired outcome. It's closed. We're worried about it. We're worried about it. Here's the problem. Yes. It's not a bit more than it's been here. It's completely gone. Yes. You change it from there. You're worried about it. It's become a little bit more than it. It's become a bit more. It's become a complete and accurate. It's become a bit more. It's almost closed. It's got a bit more. Well, it's not. It's not. It's going to be here. It's not. It's going to be between two hours. If you want to make a complete working, then you will make it. Wow. Let's leave this thing. After doing so, you can do the same thing. Select and taste case, you won't work. Then you don't know, you'll be able to do the same thing. When you're going to do the same thing, time limit exceeded. It's not that there's no error, it's not the time limit. There's no error. The recursion occurs in the recursion. It's true. There's a bit of errors in the base. If you're doing time limit exceeded, it's a lot of luck. There's a code right there. Everything is doing. But if you don't take it, you'll keep it within seconds. That's a lot of difficult. You don't know what to do. You're doing everything. It's a lot of luck. It's a lot of luck. It's a lot of luck. It's a lot of luck. It's not going to be crazy. It's not going to be crazy. It's not going to be crazy. That's why it changed the complete fee in the second semester. Second year. All phases in the sixth semester. What if the tardiesnon did so? It's a lot of luck. Fuck it. And fear about compliments, sitting there and talking a lot. It's something that named mumsah Premut … It's a lot of luck that came up on the 7th semester. It's human tertainly. That's the first class. When I'm thinking it wasn't on completamente, What does my unaras Š. It's a lot of directed and hum Lydia that's on politics. Just knowledge of science, It's Swati's, it's not a database. It's a database. And it's a work. It's a lot of people. These people are doing crazy, they're doing marketing. They're marketing consultancy. I think you should do this and you should keep it in the 20,000,000,000. And you should ask them directly. When you do marketing, you're doing it. You won't ask one question. You won't ask the technical question. Yes. You're doing a marketing intern. You're doing a degree. You're doing a degree. What are you doing in marketing? That's it. We're doing a degree. We don't apply it in the middle of the internship. That's software development. Why do we do this? Software development is a lot. It's the internet. It's telling you to get Flutter. Yeah. You should get Flutter. You should get PhD. That's it. We don't get so much. What is it? You should get Flutter. You should get R. You should read all your programming languages. There are many demands. Software development is a lot. There are many demands. Google has come two or three days ago. You don't apply it. Yes. You're a summer intern. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. We have one. One of the Amazon's students came. How much is it? Two or two. Two. One. One of the Amazon's students came. There was an ML school. There was a nationwide competition. Yes. If you qualify for that, you can find Amazon's course. Yes. Yes. That's it. We apply it for that. We have to apply it. We have to apply it for one or two days. Yes. Yes. Yes. Today, we will take the next day. We have to apply it for one or two days. Yes. So, let's check it. Let's check it. We apply it for one. Where did it come? What? Just tell me. It was on the Super Set. It was on the Super Set. And also, Amazon's. M.L.S.C.O.L.E. or something. Amazon's. Yes. ML's.C.O.L.E. or something. You can find it for a specific company. I do not know. I am going to tell you what I am going to tell you. I have a screenshot. Look at the video. I am going to tell you what I have. I will tell you what I have. You can see it. Look at the video. It is. I am going to tell you how this is. It is. And it is. I am going to tell you what it is. Amazon's. ृaufen i amezon mll summer school third it's a most early last date check if i can build We will test it this conversation as soon as possible that calls MALL often then a previousentre takie summer school I will take a few days and I will get a partner. It's great. People are always doing some work in a way. They give their training program, they give their training program, they give their training program, and they get a good job. What do they do? They will work directly in a company. They will not give training before 2-3 girls. I was doing a course in Google Analytics. I thought they were training them. They are doing something in that company. They are doing everything. They are doing everything. They are running around Google. They are using their applications. They are doing their training program. They are doing our advertising program. I don't know how many courses have done, and they are doing all of their projects. They are doing all of IBM Cloud. All of IBM Cloud. IBM Cloud is made. I had to get a cloud computing. I had to get a cloud computer. I had to get a cloud computer. And the machine learning and all of IBM built an environment. I told myself that you will make it. You will also learn how to create it. You will also learn how to create it. After doing it, you will do it on the same way. You will do it on the same way.

Without experience, you can't take it. No, there's no data. Leave it alone, just experience with people. That's a good experience with people. That's it. Now, you can raise pressure on you. Rarely, you can raise pressure on you. You can raise pressure on you. And what you do is to keep your pressure on you. You can raise pressure on you. Very much. Yeah, rarely, you can raise pressure on you. Freshers, you can't get any practice. Yeah, you can't get any practice. So, you can raise pressure on you. That's it. Rarely, but you can't get any practice. I can't Google, bro. Google, you can't get any practice. Google recruitment is not good. The rest of the people don't get good. The rest of the high profile, recruitment is not good. I've never heard the name of what you don't get. That's it. Asbel, Tesla, Tesla, so much. You don't get good. Microsoft, Google, Amazon, you don't get good. You don't get good. They don't get good. They have to open up your portal. They don't have to open the portal. Yeah. Nvidia, it's not bad. AMD, it's not bad. Inter, it's not bad. Nvidia, it's still a little. Nvidia, it's still a little. How much is it? The only way I've applied for that. I've never seen it. I don't know. We don't see anything. But whatever. You don't see many companies. the yes a good company in shell присlews plus first seven the If it's more than that, it's luck to him. With the rest of his life. Look what he's doing. Now he's done a resume. We've done a resume, but we're getting a little bit. We're not doing a short list. Where are you from ATS? We don't have that. We don't have that. We'll share the link. The resume audit, you can give it a 6 or 5 times. You can switch accounts and switch to one day. You can give it a 1 day or a 1 account? In a day, 5 times. That's a lot. I don't do that. It's going to be better. We'll see it once. Whatever you say, we'll change everything once. It's going to happen. It's going to happen. If it doesn't happen, I don't have that much accounts. I don't have that much accounts. I don't have that much accounts. How do you bring Microsoft One TV cloud? I don't have that much accounts. You're showing it once. That is my Microsoft developer ID. Oh, oh. That's right. Okay. I have a developer ID. I have a complete Microsoft e5 subscription. Enterprise Edition developer ID. So we'll get it free. We'll get it free. And it's always renewed in 90 days. Based on how you're using it. So we're talking about it. We also use it. And we're creating different stuff. We're also using it. And we're also using it. We're also using it. So we're working on it. So we're using it. So it's renewed every 90 days. So it's all. I'm using it. So it's all. So it's all. So we'll get it. So we'll get it. So we'll get it all. We'll get it all. So we'll get it. Most probably Azure access. We won't check it. We'll get it all. I'm sure. OneDrive. OneDrive. MS access.

It's fun. It's fun. It's fun. You can get it. You can get it. You can apply it in developer edition. You can apply it in developer edition. You can do it. Yes. No. You can do it. Actually, it needs to be storage. Storage is not exactly. We need to know what it is. What is the name? What is the name? I mean, one computer, another computer, data that you need to do this every time. You can do it every time. You can keep it in cloud. Yes. But in that, because it's a developer edition, you have to use Microsoft apps. You don't have to use it. You can do it. You can do it. Yes. If you don't use it, then you cancel the subscription. It's 90 days. It's about 3 months. It's about 30 days. It's about 30 days. I've talked about 5 people. We've given it. I've got a brother, a wife, two, three months. I've got a brother. I've got a brother. I've got a use it. I'm still using it. I'm still using it. You'll have to send it. You'll have to send it to you too. How much space will you get? What you say, how much you need. It'll be in 1.5. It'll be in 1.5. We'll send it. We'll send it. There's no need. Okay, okay. There's no restrictions. We can literally get a user's access to Microsoft apps. You can change the subscription, device access, OneDrive access. But no one has access to anyone. Oh must I claim ID. So it's kinda just an app. Okay, so 5 must secure one but just a one of the circset specifications one of it. That's great for me. So that's a example. That happens too. You forget to make yourself a part of the service and your Defender. So buy you a little bit too. You'll do it. If we have a special tutorial twenty four months we can send me to you. Cool. If nobody says you need to bring your ID, then we're just giving me. So, that's nice. Okay, we'll talk about the night. I'm so hungry and I'm hungry. I'm hungry. Okay, I'm hungry. Okay, I'm hungry. Okay, I'm hungry.
