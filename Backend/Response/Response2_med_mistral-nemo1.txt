Based on the conversation, here's a summary of their current practices and considerations when treating locally advanced rectal cancer:

1. **Single Modality vs Combination:**
   - They prefer a single local treatment modality if possible (chemo, radiation, or surgery) to preserve function better.
   - Combining chemo/radiation with surgery is generally worse than using either one alone.

2. **Oprah Study:**
   - They follow the Oprah study's approach: long-course chemo-radiation followed by consolidative systemic therapy for intermediate-risk tumors.
   - For high-risk tumors, they consider organ preservation and intensify treatment with full fluorouracil.

3. **Response Assessment:**
   - They perform response assessment around 8 weeks after chemotherapy completion (range of 4-12 weeks).
   - They use MRI, digital exam, and endoscopy to assess responses.
   - If there's a complete response on all modalities, they proceed with active surveillance.

4. **Near Complete Response:**
   - There's concern about poor disease-free survival outcomes for near complete responders from recent Oprah study updates.
   - They still consider active surveillance if patients have a complete response at the second assessment but emphasize informed consent regarding potential risks.

5. **MSI High Status:**
   - They stress the importance of testing for MSI high status to identify patients who may benefit from single-agent immune checkpoint inhibitors.

6. **Current Trends:**
   - Dr. Schrag mentions that while Oprah study interpretation is controversial, some physicians still prioritize starting treatment quickly with whichever modality can provide the earliest relief.
   - Dr. Schrag also highlights new data validating the high response rate of immune checkpoint inhibitors in MSI-high rectal cancer patients.
