**Summary:**

1. **Treatment Options:**
   - Long course chemo radiation followed by consolidated fluorox based systemic therapy is preferred due to better preservation of bladder and sexual function.
   - For high-risk tumors, intensified treatment with full fluorouracil may be used.
   - Response assessment around 4-12 weeks after chemotherapy completion is reasonable.

2. **Active Surveillance:**
   - Complete response on MRI, digital exam, and endoscopy allows for active surveillance.
   - Near complete responders should have close follow-up before considering active surveillance.

3. **MSI High Status:**
   - Testing for MSI high status is crucial as these patients can have a 100% response rate to single-agent immune checkpoint inhibitors.

4. **Organ Preservation:**
   - Selective omission of surgery can be considered in the right patient population, preserving organ function and improving quality of life.

5. **Discussion on Oprah Study:**
   - The Oprah study is controversial; some physicians prefer starting the most quickly available modality for patient relief.
   - Its phase II status should be considered when interpreting outcomes.

6. **Current Treatment Landscape:**
   - Increasing incidence of rectal cancer requires appreciation of nuances in treatment options.
   - Total neoadjuvant treatment remains viable, but selecting appropriate patients is crucial.
   - Improved radiation modalities and organ preservation strategies should be considered.
