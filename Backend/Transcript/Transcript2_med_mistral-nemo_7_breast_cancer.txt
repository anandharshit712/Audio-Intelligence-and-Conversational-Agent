 speaker1 : Thank you so much. Have a seat on the couch, please. Yes, you are. This is the view. We're pretend. We just need our coffee mugs, right? All right, so we're gonna go ahead and get started with the breast cancer case. I am so glad to be joined by my colleagues. I have directly to my last reshu Tani from Miami Cancer Institute. Thank you so much for joining us. We're so sorry about the weather in Kansas, but we're grateful that you are willing to give us a try. I was supposed to bring the sunshine. I know, I know. And doctor Patty Tanoski from Ascension at Kansas, who is a breast surgeon in Wichita. We're so grateful and grateful to have you. So we're going to jump right in. First, let me just say that there is so much to cover about breast cancer treatment this year. This past year has really been an incredibly exciting year. Tons of new drugs approved and new indications. So we cannot possibly take a very deep dive into that data today. So we picked out just one case which we think highlights probably the most important change in treatment. And then we're going to follow that with just a couple of data points for you. But we just want to let you know, we're limited by this 30 minutes timeframe today, so we're going to try to keep it very, very high level. So our first, the patient we're going to discuss today is a 34 year old preventopausal patient that presents with a 3.8 centimeter left breast mask. She has a diagnostic mammogram and sonogram that confirmed the presence of a mass in addition to two suspicious axillary lymph nodes. She has a biopsy of the breast in one of the axillary nose, which shows invasive duct carcinoma, which is grade three. This is triple negative CRP, which by immunohistochemistry, so clinical stage t two and one. So stage two, triple negative breast cancer. And of course, this is a 34 year old with triple negative breast cancer. So absolutely want to do genetic testing. I appreciate Katie and Lauren and Ani for emphasizing the importance of genetic testing. So critically important. Now, based on the NCCN guidelines, all patients with triple negative breast cancer should have genetic testing. So obviously, this 34 year old very, very important and bouncy negative. Here you see an image of an axillary ultrasound with a single morphologically abnormal level one node coronatal biopsy is obtained and this shows metastatic doctor carcinoma. And importantly, a clip is placed and Doctor Tanosky is going to comment for us later on the importance of that. What we are going to do is talk a bit about how we would approach, how we would approach a patient that presents with stage two triple negative breast cancer. And as I mentioned earlier this morning when we were talking about the her two positive early case, we know that pathologic complete response, that is achieving a complete response to the neoadvin treatment, is incredibly important. And there's really no greater example of this in breast cancer than in our patients that have negative breast cancer. So here in this graph, you can see the impact of pathological complete response on outcome. So in the neoad chemotherapy setting, this has become the standard of care, because we see that the patients that achieve a pathogenic response have far superior outcomes to those patients that do not have a complete pathologic response. So understanding that response helps us tailor the treatment in the advent study. It can help inform their adjuvant therapy recommendations. We know that pathological complete response occurs in about 30% of patients with triple negative breast cancer. For those patients that don't have pathologic complete response, the risk of recurrence is incredibly high. And that is a tremendous area of unmet need and a great area of research as we try to understand what additional treatments we can offer for those particular patients. We know that once patients recur with triple negative breast cancer, the prognosis is extremely poor. On average, overall survival is about 18 months. So a better understanding of what is actually driving triple negative breast cancer and the development of targeted therapies is very badly needed. So at this point, I'm going to hand it over to Doctor Nutani, who's going to highlight for us one of the most important studies of the year, really practice changing for us. Keynote 522 thank you. So, as doctor O'Day mentioned, there's been some so much exciting news over the last year in breast cancer. And we chose to highlight these data because it did lead to the approval of prelizomab in the early stage setting in July of 2021, based on this really important trial, the keynote 522 study. And just as a reminder, this study looked at patients that had stage two or three triple negative breast cancer with a good performing status. Tissue sample for PD L one was done. I'll highlight as we go through the data, that the efficacy that we saw in this important study was actually independent of PD L one status, which is quite a bit different than what we're seeing in the metastatic setting. So a large number of patients, over 1000, were randomized two to one to heal chemotherapy, which included a platinum carboplatin, either every three weeks or weekly, and paclotaxel followed by anthracycline based chemo. And that regimen was given in combination with peprolizumab or the other arm was with placebo in the same chemotherapy backbone. And then after surgery, regardless of whether patients achieved a pcr or nothing, was not a second randomization. The patients that received Pembro up front were continuing Pembro in the adjuvant setting for nine cycles, about 27 weeks. That's six months of therapy. I'll just make a few comments about chemotherapy back home, because there's been a fair bit of discussion about this. So first, the incorporation of platinum. I think the investigators were really mindful of the fact that they wanted to make sure that we had our best chemotherapy regimens all delivered preoperatively, so that there wasn't the criticism that, oh, well, maybe these patients didn't get optimal chemo. There had been a fair bit of discussion about the benefit of platinum in the neoadjuvant setting, and it wasn't really being routinely incorporated. We had several studies that showed it increased the pathologic completely response rate. More recently, there was an important trial called the brightness study, which looked at long term outcomes, event free survival in patients that had had neoadj and platinum, and it showed an improvement in event free survival. So I think, again, the investigators were really mindful of the fact that we wanted to make sure that that chemotherapy backbone were our best drugs. Another comment about the Q three week anthracite as opposed to dose dense, because there's always the understanding that dose dense therapy is important in triple negative disease. I think that decision was made more based on just the pragmatic approach of these patients have gone through weekly platinum and taxane, and they're a bit beat up at that time point. So to be able to go on to q two week ac would be a bit problematic. And then, of course, just the practical standpoint of syncing it up with the Pembroke dosing given q three weeks. So from a practical perspective, is that something we were discussing amongst our breast medal group very recently? Are you following strictly what was done here, or have you adapted the schedule? I know some of my colleagues are still doing the dose dense, but having the patients come in additionally, for the Q three week pembrolizumab, are you using growth factor in the every three week dosing schedule? How are you approaching that? Yeah, so my approach is you can't argue with success. You know, the trial did every three week dosing and that's the way it was done in the study. And the important outcomes that we'll see in the next few slides are demonstrated with that dosing. So I'm following a Q three week dosing, and I really do think that weekly treatment up front is really difficult for patients. By the time they get through that twelve weeks of therapy, many of them have had dose delays and required growth factor support. And even though typically I don't usually do a growth factor with Q three week dosing of ac, by the time they get to that point, a lot of them need it because their bone marrow is kind of beat up. I think that's been the experience we've seen in our group when we're starting to incorporate that regimen. It's really a tough regimente. So, okay, the primary endpoint, as I mentioned, there were two co primary endpoints of TAF CR and event free survival, assessed by investigator and the intent to treat population. And then there were several secondary endpoints, as shown here. And exploratory analyses were done as well. Just in terms of the patients that went on this protocol, you'll see that the median age, and this is what we would expect in a patient population with triple negative disease. We tend to see a lot younger patients. About 48 49 performance status was one in about 12% of the patients there. PD L one, positivity 80%. But again, the results that we'll go through were really important in that there was no differential benefit based on PD L one status, and then weekly carboplatin was given in the majority of patients. And in my practice, that's what I'm following as well, in about 50 50, almost even split in terms of nodal involvement. So we had seen data originally that showed an improvement in pathologic complete response. And here the delta was 13.6% difference in pathway complete response. And I think we had gone through the importance of that as a prognostic endpoint. So, understanding that the incorporation of immunotherapy was able to increase capacity is certainly clinically meaningful, because we know the impact that that has going forward. Comment for us, if you will, about the delta AR 13.6. I mean, we think about in triple negative breast cancer to be able to see something move the needle that much. I mean, to me, this speaks loudly as to the impact of the immunotherapy. What are your thoughts about that?
speaker2 : Yeah, I would agree.
speaker1 : And, you know, I think in an earlier slide, we had said that about 30% of the GPCR, I think more modern studies would show that that number is a bit higher, more into the forties, or 50% range, as we saw in the control arm here. But that jump of 15 points almost in the past CR, I think that that is really, really an important endpoint. And we tend to think of a lot of the progress that we've made in breast cancer as incremental gains. But when you see such a dramatic result like this, I think that that seems more like a leap, and that's great news for our patients. Even so, then, the long term outcomes that we were really interested in seeing is primary event free analysis. And so here we saw about 8% difference, again favoring the capitalizumab. And this was, again, something that, as we're looking at path CR as our early time point, what we really want to know is, is that translating into improved longer term outcomes, and that's what we were able to demonstrate in this analysis. As we look at the perspective, the subgroup analyses, and look at the patients that benefited, you may think that it might just be other patients that have no positive disease that would garner the benefit. But here in the subgroup analysis, you see that the benefit for the eventbreed survival benefit was seen regardless of nodal status, even stage two tumors. So I think this comes up a lot in clinic, because you see the patient with the larger tumor that's known negative, and you wonder, does that woman really need all of this treatment? Well, according to this analysis, we would suggest that, yes, she does.
speaker2 : Really.
speaker1 : Larger tumor is 2 mean, it's not even a huge tumor. It can be a 2.82.9 centimeter tumor node negative. Those patients clearly benefited here in terms of event three survival. And then again, this is extremely clinically meaningful, because what we want to see is a difference in distant progression or distant recurrence free survival as our patients when they do develop metastatic disease, as doctor Odette mentioned earlier, the prognosis is pretty poor, although we've made some great strides in metastatic TNBC of late as well. Certainly it represents the subgroup of breast cancer where we have the most work that we still need to do. So being able to spare our patients distant recurrences is, of course, the end goal here. I'll just mention a word or two about immune related side effects, and I'd love to hear about your experience. One thing that I think we're very fortunate in breast cancer is that we have benefited from the experience of our colleagues that treat other tumor types where immunotherapy has been used much more frequently of late. We've started using immunotherapy and the metastatic, and now, based on these data, the adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting. And so it's been a bit of a learning curve. Some of these side effects can be very insidious, very difficult to pick up. So they really need to be on your radar and on the radar in patients. And there's a fair bit of education that needs to. What's your experience been? Absolutely. And I find myself just so grateful for my fellows and my clinic, who had a great deal of experience in the GU and the long space that has utilized a great deal of IO. But just kind of this slide we wanted to include, because we have a great number of primary care colleagues here today in the room and joining us virtually. And just to think about these patients might not, especially when they're in their adjuvant portion of their pendrolizumab, right. They might be four or five months out from their breast cancer treatment, still getting this every three weeks, pembrolizumab, and they present with shortness of breath and a cough. They might go to the family medicine doctor, they might not necessarily call us. So it's very important for us to be aware of the broad sort of range of toxicity that we can see with, with checkpoint inhibitor. So just to divide by body system here you see the endocrine. We definitely see a great deal of thyroid dysfunction. I think that's the thing I've probably seen the most commonly, and so that's something we have to screen for regularly. If we're not looking for it, we won't find it until the patients are often highly symptomatic. Respiratory. Of course, the pneumonitis is something we have to watch out for, and it really requires early institutional treatment. Hepatitis, that is something I recently experienced, unfortunately, with a neoadjuvant patient with an IO induced hepatitis. I'm so grateful for our hepatology colleagues in the hospital to help us manage that. But again, these are things we really have to astutely be looking for. Nephritis, the patients obviously can deal with that. Unfortunately, I had a recent case of that for a very young patient with absolutely no predisposing factors for renal dysfunction, that developed an acute nephritis after only the second dose of abdomen from the losing mouth. So that's the other thing, I think, in my experience, and I would be curious to hear your thoughts about this as well. This doesn't seem to necessarily be a cumulative toxicity for something that can happen at any point in the treatment. And so there can be late presentations. And that's something, again, that we're not using to seeing with other sorts of therapy that we're dealing with. And another pearl that I would just mention is that in patients that do develop thyroid issues, it's really important to also make sure that that patient doesn't have concomitant adrenal insufficiency, because that can be linked. The other thing is, for these patients that are getting neoadjuvant chemo and IO and that are going to surgery, it's really important to check your cortisol, because obviously, you don't want to miss adrenal insufficiency in a patient that's about to go to the OR. Absolutely. Thank you for that. Neurologic. I know my colleague Lauren has had a difficult, challenging case with a patient that developed significant encephalitis from IO treatment. We see, in terms of eye congestivitis, bronchitis, retinitis, all different kinds of inflammatory eye conditions, conditions, cardiovascular, we're seeing that less commonly, myocarditis, pericarditis, and vasculitis, something that we do have to be aware that that can happen. And then, of course, the GI issue, that is, I think the thing that probably tends to be the most obvious. You know, the patients are calling in with diarrhea, which the tricky part is that when they're getting their chemotherapy concomitantly with the IO, it's always tricky. At least I found it difficult to know how much of that is caused from the chemotherapy and how much of it is caused from the IO, obviously treated differently. The chemotherapy induced diarrhea we would treat with antithiarrheal agents, and the colitis would need to be treated with high doses of steroids. So sometimes that can be difficult for us to sort out and engaging with our colleagues and other tumor types. So this particular patient, we would start as a young patient with stage two triple negative breast cancer. We would start her based on the newly approved and data that we just showed you, from five two, she would start neon three chemotherapy. And so in my practice, I've been starting people on exactly the regimen used in the trial, with the dose and schedule used in the trial, as you have been doing as well following chemotherapy, she has an excellent clinical response, so her mass is no longer palpable, it's no longer, apparently, radiographically. And end of treatment sonogram demonstrates a complete imaging response in both the breast and the axilla. And so, importantly, she had a placement of that clip in that positive axillary node, but complete imaging response in the breast in XLS. So, Doctor Tanoski, we just want to ask you to comment at this point. Now, you're faced with operating on this patient that has no clinically apparent cancer, and how do you approach that? What are your thoughts as you work.
speaker2 : Through that so well? Obviously it makes it easier for me.
speaker1 : So I appreciate my colleagues.
speaker2 : Historically, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was used different. We would have very large cancers, inflammatory breast cancers, which still happen locally, advanced breast cancers, and we would actually need our colleagues to help us shrink the tumor, so we could even do a mastectomy. Over time, we were able to convert the mastectomies to breast conservation, and Newad can help us have better cosmetic results. Now we've actually started converting node positive patients to no negative patients, which can allow us to emit axillary node dissection and decrease our result in morbidity, which is mostly lymphedema, which I'll talk about in a second. We see response rates of up to 90%.
speaker1 : Even before the newer.
speaker2 : Regimens that they were talking about, we saw good response rates. You hardly ever saw someone progress less than 5% of the time. So sometimes just shrinking 50% would help us be able to conserve the breast. Overall pathologic complete response is about 20% to 30%, as we talked about. And of course it's much higher with her two positive tumors and higher triple negative. It's lowest in our ER, positive tumors. In this particular patient, I would have a conversation with her, and I would have actually spoken to her before we started treatment. She would have had an MRI to make sure there was no other disease, and we would have her completely worked up before she started neoadjuvant chemotherapy. And then we would discuss lumpectomy versus mastectomy. In this situation, the tumor was fairly large to begin with. It has shrunk, it's gone. The only way we know is there is the clip that was placed in it for biopsy. So she is certainly a candidate for lumpectomy. Now, it's important to note that especially in triple negative breast cancer, there's absolutely no difference in survival between breast conservation and there's no difference in local recurrence with breast conservation.
speaker1 : This is always a surprise to my patients.
speaker2 : Sometimes I feel like they fall off their chair when I say that, and they doubt me sometimes. But the research is very clear that with triple negative breast cancer, there is no difference in local recurrence even. There's even some research studies that show.
speaker1 : That there might be a little bit.
speaker2 : Of a benefit to breast conservation with triple negative, and that's all about radiation. We can't.
speaker1 : The surgeons can't take credit for that.
speaker2 : Triple negative cancer, definitely, as we talked about, is associated with BRCA. So I would for sure make sure she has had BRCA testing, because most women with BRCA at this young age choose preventative mastectomies if she had the ERCA gene, but this particular patient does not. So ultimately, it's the patient's choice. After a good, informed discussion and education is given to her, if she is leaning toward a mastectomy, we have to discuss the possibility of radiation. It's never for sure or not for sure with triple negative breast cancer. After Leo Adjuvant, we don't have the research trials to tell us what the right answer is here. So I have to explain to her she may get radiation and that could affect reconstruction, so we have to discuss the pluses and minuses of reconstruction if she has to have radiation or not.
speaker1 : And the risk involved with that.
speaker2 : Now, coming to the lymph node, this is the most exciting part about better responses with chemotherapy, because salvaging lymph nodes can really improve the quality of life for these women. We now do something called a targeted axillary node dissection. And the patient's exactly like this particular patient. The patient will have its lips placed at the time of her diagnosis into the known positive node and into the cancer in her breast at the time of surgery. Instead of doing an axillary node dissection.
speaker1 : Which is what we did for years.
speaker2 : And years, she had a positive node, so we would do a node dissection. And that happened until just a few.
speaker1 : Years ago when some trials said, this.
speaker2 : Particular technique is safe. What I would do at surgery is I would remove lymph node that has the clip in it because I knew it was positive to begin with, and I have to confirm that I removed it. So I have to do an x ray proving the clip is out. So I took out the correct lymph node that used to be positive, and then we use radioactive sulfur colloid to help find the first lymph node in the chain of lymph nodes and a.
speaker1 : Blue dye as well.
speaker2 : And I hope to take out Athens and one more node or two more.
speaker1 : Nodes, and all of those nodes will.
speaker2 : Be sent to the pathologist while the patient is still in the operating room. And if they are all negative, then I can stop and I don't have to do an axillary node dissection. If the central node is positive, then we will continue to do the axillary node dissection.
speaker1 : From a technical standpoint, from a surgeon.
speaker2 : Standpoint, sometimes finding the click node is hard, because chemo not only makes the lymph nodes turn negative, it also shrinks.
speaker1 : The nodes like crazy.
speaker2 : So these lymph nodes after chemotherapy are tiny, tiny one or 2 mm. Sometimes you can't hardly see them. So sometimes it's very difficult to find that lymph node after chemotherapy. It's not easy.
speaker1 : Like in this picture where you see the clip in there. Doctor, a question came in. Can you just comment about how clipp migration impacts the surgical approach? So both in the primary tumor and in the axillary, how often do you encounter that? How do you approach that?
speaker2 : I countered it quite a bit. So the most important thing is if the cliff has migrated, we need to make note of that. So after the four months or six months or however long the patient has chemotherapy, that we know where the actual tumor is and not where the clip is, they can be several centimeters apart. So sometimes that would require a different clip in even before they start chemo, we absolutely confirm that the clip is in the correct position before they would.
speaker1 : Start chemotherapy, both in the lymph node.
speaker2 : And in the breast. And that may require placing another clip. Finding the clip in the breast is easy because you can do a mammogram, and you can put a wire in.
speaker1 : Like we've done for years and years and years.
speaker2 : But finding the lymph node clip can be hard, because sometimes the lymph node is too high for the mammogram to reach. So how do you find it? Sometimes you can see it on ultrasound. If you can't find it, you have to do an axillary node dissection. So we have come up with techniques, new technology, fantastic technology, where you can put a clip in the lymph node that has either radar in it or radio frequency or magnetic, and then you have a device, like in the picture, where I can put it on the armpit, even months and months later, and it will beep and tell me where it's at. And that technology is not available in my town. I'm trying.
speaker1 : I think you all have it, but.
speaker2 : My town of Wichita does not have it. So that technology is the most important.
speaker1 : Piece of technology for this particular procedure.
speaker2 : And it can save a woman for him to have all her nodes. So I think it's important, even though it's pricing. So let's say the node converts to negative we don't do an absolute node dissection. If she's having a lumpectomy, it's easy. She has to have radiation.
speaker1 : That's standard care for a lump vaccine.
speaker2 : Now, doing extended heels or tangents is controversial. That's when you radiate up around the collarbone and do extended heels. That's controversial. With a mastectomy, most say no to radiation if the patient has a complete pathologic response. Nothing in the breast, nothing in the lymph nodes, it still is controversial. I have radiation oncologists who have radiate.
speaker1 : This patient, no matter whether she has. Yeah, I would say at our institution, what we would do is those patients all have a consultation with the rest radiation oncologists and have careful, thoughtful discussion about the risks and benefits and then shared decision making. But, yes, very controversial.
speaker2 : We do not have the answer. But this trial, NSAB B 51, should give us the answer. It will help answer both controversies here, because patients from both groups are placed in the trial. It will help know who need extended heels of lumpectomy, and it will help us know if mastectomy patients need radiation if they have a complete pathologic response. The trial is accrued, and we're awaiting results. So this is going to help us so much with our. For our reconstruction patients to know whether they need radiation or not. Now, the sentinel note is positive, or if I can't find the clip or I can't find any sentinel nodes. Why would that happen? Sometimes happens if the patient started with inflammatory breast cancer, because the lymphatic channels are full of cancer and they are.
speaker1 : Included, and it just doesn't work.
speaker2 : If you cannot find a sentinel node.
speaker1 : Or the cliff node, you have to.
speaker2 : Do an axillary node dissection, or if the sentinel node is still positive, to do next, or note dissection. That is the current standard of care in 2022. But this trial, this alliance trial, this is an amazing trial. I put patients into this trial, and we are now awaiting results. This trial, if the sentinel node was.
speaker1 : Positive, I would call.
speaker2 : They will randomize my patient to either.
speaker1 : Get a node dissection or not.
speaker2 : And if they were randomized, to not.
speaker1 : Get a node dissection, I would have to stop.
speaker2 : And it felt kind of strange because that's against what I've been doing for.
speaker1 : Years and years and years.
speaker2 : So I had patients in both sides of the trial. If it shows that radiation is as good as doing an x or no thanks section, we won't be doing absolutely no directions anymore, and that will be practice changing.
speaker1 : Hopefully that'll be something we'll be talking about next year.
speaker2 : Doesn't know. It seems like when there's no difference.
speaker1 : In the two groups, the trials take.
speaker2 : Longer, which is a good thing. So, for me, neoadjuvant chemotherapy has significant benefits. It can allow breast preservation when the.
speaker1 : Tumor is initially too large for this.
speaker2 : Which in the first picture, I just showed a mammogram and an ultrasound showing tumors shrinking. They didn't go away, but they shrank. And that's going to make me look better as a surgeon when I don't have to take as much tissue out.
speaker1 : The breast is going to look better.
speaker2 : In the second picture of the MRI, there, you see the cancer was completely away and there's nothing left.
speaker1 : All I would do is take the.
speaker2 : Little tissue around the cliff to make sure there's no cancer there, and the.
speaker1 : Patient would have an excellent cosmetic result.
speaker2 : But also, what's new is that we can allow a positive node to convert to negative utilizing a targeted axial node dissection, preserving lymph nodes, and decreasing our.
speaker1 : Most dreaded complication, which is lymphedema, which is shown in that picture. Perfect. Thank you so much for that. So, one of the things we just want to summarize, and this is so critically important, because as we saw in our patient that had a complete pathologic response, it's important for us to look at the results from keynote five to two. And what we see is that if you look at the two, the top two curves, that is the group of patients that all had a complete pathologic response, looking at the difference between those that received advent pembrolizumab and those that received placebo. So you can see that even in the group of patients that had a complete pathologic response, there is a numerical difference of about 2% for receiving the advent pembrolizumab. So, again, this is something that I've seen when we're doing second opinions and other things. I don't know if you've run into this where patients are sometimes being told that because they have a pathological disease response, they don't need the adjuvant pembrolizumab. But in fact, there is a numerical difference here, and we don't have a way to predict, maybe not all of the patients that get a pastdr will end up needing adjuvant hembolism. But right now, we have no way to predict the patients that will benefit and those that will not. So this is critically important. And then, of course, the patients that do not have pathologic complete response. You can see the impact there on recurrence. Their recurrence rates are much higher and the greater impact of pembrolizumab, obviously because they have a higher risk of recurrence. So important for us to remind ourselves that. So just a couple of conclusions for us in the phase three keynote 522 neoadjuvant primbolizumab and chemotherapy followed by adjunct primbolizumab results in a highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in event three survival. The prespecified event three survival sensitivity analysis showed a robust treatment benefit of neo advanced pembro plus chemo followed by adjuvant pembroke from previously untreated non metastatic triple negative breast cancer patients. The benefit was generally consistent across a broad selection of prespecified subgroups, including those defined by nodal status and overall disease stage. The safety was consistent with what we know about cumbrolizumab. These results further support pembrolizumab plus patin containing neoasmic chemo followed by asthma and pembro after surgery as a new standard of care regimen for patients with high risk early stage triple negative breast cancer. So this is absolutely one of those practice changing things that happen sort of the Monday morning, you know, change of, change of standard of care for all of us quickly because we're out of time. But I couldn't let this pass again. As I mentioned, this has been an incredibly busy year for us in breast cancer early stage disease and we don't have time to talk about a case in regards to the monarch e study. But I did want to talk about our hormone positive, her two negative patients. So those that have no positive high risk early breast cancer. So you can see here the different cohorts from monarch e and cohort one, four or more axillary lymph nodes or patients can have lesser nodal involvement but have at least one adverse risk factor, including grade three or a tumor size over 5. In cohort two. Those patients a similar sort of transformation, but based on ki 67 as well. So these are high risk hormone positive, her two negative. This was over 5500 patients that were randomized in a one to one fashion to receive adjuvant abemacyclib, of course a CBK 46 inhibitor at the dose of 150 milligrams twice a daily for up to two years, plus standard of care endocrine therapy for five to ten years as whatever is clinically indicated or standard of care indigenous therapy. So basically the standard antiestrogen therapy or the standard antiestrogen therapy plus a Bimcycliffe CDK 46 inhibitor. The primary objective, invasive disease free survival. And what you can see here, of course, for the group of patients that received a bimbocycliffe plus endocrine therapy with invasive disease, resurvival at 92.2% compared to 88.7. And you see there on your right, the distant relapse resurvival 93.6 compared to 90.3. So this, of course, led to the approval of adjuvant abomacycline for us. And just to look at the impact of Ki 67, this is something that we now have incorporated as standard for all of our pathologic specimens at our institution. And I'm sure you're doing that now as well, because Ki 67 was an important predictor in this particular study for response. So the FDA approval for adjuvant of a recycled plus endocrine therapy for those selected high risk, hormone positive early breast cancer patients, in combination with endocrine therapy and the FDA indications here is very specific. We were all a little bit perplexed and surprised that they put this very specific Ki 67 of over 20%. However, the ASCO, ASCO guidelines were quickly updated because many of us felt that the approval really should have reflected what was done in the clinical trial. Right, which is what the ASCO guidelines specify. So, effectively, we're recommending adjuvant cyclists for any patient that would have been eligible for the trial. So that includes patients that have higher lymph node involvement or have larger tumor size. Grade three, high Ki 67. You can see the ascii guidelines here. Those are widely available for anyone to just pull up on Google. And so I would encourage you, when you're seeing all of your patients back in clinic that are now, you know, finishing their surgery, finishing their radiation, you're having the endocrine therapy. Discussion. We now have to have an additional discussion. Is this patient eligible for CDK 46 event cycler? So, something that's incredibly important for us. So again, we talked about the summary from keynote 522. Doctor Chanoski shared with us some important information about limited axillary dissection. I'm so glad to know more about that. And then the monarch e trial, which led to the approval of adjunct abemacycliffe in addition to endocrine therapy for a hormone positive, high risk, early stage breast cancer patients. That was a super whirlwind. There's so much more that we want to be able to discuss, but time constraints today don't allow us to do that. So I want to thank you all. Thank you guys for coming from Wichita and from Miami. We're so grateful. All right.
