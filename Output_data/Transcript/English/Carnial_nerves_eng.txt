This is a video in Clinical Medicine from the New England Journal of medicine. There are 12 pairs of cranial nerves that emerge directly from the brain and are responsible for many functions including movement and the senses of sight, hearing, balance, smell, taste, touch, and temperature. Each cranial nerve has a specific function and the location of an injury to these nerves can be determined by obtaining the medical history as well as by performing a physical examination. This video demonstrates how to perform a comprehensive cranial nerve examination to assess a patient with a suspended expected cranial nerve disorder. First, obtain an in depth general medical history. A thorough history can guide the physical examination. Next, test the function of all 12 cranial nerves. Cranial nerve lesions can affect one or both sides of the body, so it is important to examine each side and compare the results. The olfactory nerve is responsible for smell and taste. To test the function of the olfactory nerve, ask the patient to close their eyes. Then present an easily identifiable odor such as coffee, to each nostril while the other nostril is occluded. If the patient is unable to identify the odor, injury to the olfactory nerve is suspected. Note that the olfactory nerve is often not tested and debate exists surrounding the utility of testing each nostril independently due to admixture of odors and nasal the optic nerve is responsible for vision. To test the function of the optic nerve, begin with a visual field test. Stand about 4ft away from the patient and ask the patient to look directly at your nose. Then ask the patient to close the left eye or cover it with their hand while you do the same with your right eye. Now present between one to five fingers in each of the four quadrants of the visual field and ask the patient how many fingers are being presented. It is important that you place your hand halfway between you and the patient, since this will allow for accurate comparison and testing of the patient's visual fields. The examination should be performed again on the opposite side. Next, ask the patient to cover one eye. Then perform a visual acuity test of the other eye using a Snellen chart or a handheld chart about 14 inches from the patient's face. If the patient wears corrective lens, they should be wearing them for the duration of the visual examination. The third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerves are responsible for eye movements. In patients with a third cranial nerve palsy, the affected eye is fixed inferiorly and laterally at rest and it cannot be adducted. In patients with a fourth cranial nerve palsy, the affected eye is turned superiorly and laterally, and it moves even more superiorly with adduction. In patients with a sixth cranial nerve palsy, the affected eye is fixed medially and it cannot be abducted. To test the function of these nerves, begin by performing a gross examination of the eyes and eyelids to look for any asymmetry or involuntary movements. Next, ask the patient to keep the head still and track your finger. Move your finger to all four quadrants of the visual field following an H pattern. Also move your finger toward the tip of the patient's nose and look for convergence and pupillary constriction. Abnormal or asymmetric movements may indicate a palsy, which would require further testing with the alternate cover or red glass test or a consult with a neuro ophthalmologist. Then dim the lights in the room and ask the patient to focus on an object that is about 10 to 15ft away. Shine a light into the patient's eyes, one eye at a time, and observe the pupillary response. The pupil should constrict and a consensual response in the other pupil should be observed. A swinging flashlight test can be performed at this time, shining light directly into the patient's eye for two to three seconds, then swing the light into the other eye for the same amount of time. In a normal response, both pupils will constrict equally when the light is shown. Either high abnormal pupillary dilation or a delayed response could be indicative of a relative afferent pupillary defect secondary to conditions such as optic neuritis or central retinal artery occlusion. The fifth Cranial nerve, the trigeminal nerve is responsible for sensation in the face and mastication. It is divided into three ophthalmic, maxillary, and mandibular. To test the function of the trigeminal nerve, assess the sensation to pain by performing a pinprick test on the patient's face using a new clean disposable safety pin or similar object. Ask the patient to close the eyes and tell you where the pinprick is felt. Alternatively, assess the sensation to light touch by gently brushing a soft object such as a cotton swab or tissue against the patient's face. Be sure to touch each side of the face one side at a time. Inability to localize sensation or relative asymmetry across both sides of the face is abnormal, and injury to the trigeminal nerve should be suspected. Finally, to test the motor division of the mandibular branch, palpate the masseter muscles on each side of the face and ask the patient to clench the teeth. Muscle tone and Bulk should be equal on both sides. Also, ask the patient to open the jaw against resistance. If a pterygoid muscle is weak, the jaw deviates to that side when the mouth is opened. The facial nerve provides motor innervation to the muscles involved in facial expression and also innervates the lacrimal and salivary glands. To assess the function of the facial nerve, begin by observing the patient's facial expressions. Asymmetry of facial muscle movements may indicate a lesion. Ask the patient to grimace, smile, or puff out the cheeks. The presence of weakness in only the lower facial muscles may indicate a central lesion as opposed to a peripheral lesion. The eighth cranial nerve is primarily responsible for hearing through the cochlear branch and balance through the vestibular branch. As such, assessment of the function of the eighth cranial nerve consists of two components, hearing tests and vestibular function tests. Test the hearing in each ear by whispering or gently rubbing the tips of the fingers together in front one ear while the patient's eyes are closed and ask the patient which ear hears the sound. If hearing loss is suspected, further audiologic testing is recommended. You may also perform the Weber and RIN tests, which are typically reserved for patients who present with auditory symptoms. To perform the Weber test, place the base of a struck tuning fork on the top of the head or bridge of the nose. In a patient with normal hearing, there will be no lateralization of sound, which means that the sound will be equally loud in both cases. However, in a patient with unilateral conductive hearing loss, the sound will lateralize to or be louder in the affected ear. In a patient with unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, the sound will lateralize to the unaffected ear. To perform the written test, place the base of a struck tuning fork on the mastoid bone posterior to the ear. Ask the patient to notify you when they can no longer hear the sound. Then place the struct tuning fork directly beside the patient patient's ear and ask whether the sound is now audible. In a patient with normal hearing, for whom air conductance is greater than bone conductance, the sound will be audible. However, in a patient with conductive hearing loss, for whom bone conductance is greater than air conductance, the sound will not be audible. Vestibular function is evaluated by performing the horizontal head impulse test. Begin the test with the patient in a seated position. Ask the patient to relax and hold their gaze on the bridge of your nose. Grasp the head from both sides. Rapidly rotate the head so that the patient's nose is approximately 20 degrees off center and then gently move the head to the midlight position while observing the patient's eyes. In a patient with a peripheral vestibular lesion, an abnormal response with quick corrective saccades back to the target occurs with head rotation. The head impulse test is normal with no corrective in a patient with a central vestibular lesion. Of note, nystagmus or rapid uncontrollable eye movement is a common feature in a variety of vestibular diseases. If an eighth cranial nerve lesion is suspected, referral to an otolaryngologist may be necessary. The glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves are commonly evaluated simultaneously. The glossopharyngeal nerve provides motor innervation to the pharynx and contributes to swallowing. It also provides sensory innervation to the posterior third of the tongue and pharynx and contributes to the afferent limb of the gag reflex. The vagus nerve has many autonomic functions in the gut and heart. It also provides sensation to the larynx and pharynx, innervates vocal cord musculature, assists with swallowing, and provides stimulation for the efferent limb of the gag reflex. Assess the function of the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. Ask the patient to say ah and note whether the palate elevates symmetrically. If one side of the palate does not elevate, a lesion may be present. You may also stimulate the gag reflex by using a tongue blade to scrape the posterior pharynx on both sides. Also note the presence of hoarseness, which could indicate a lesion involving a branch of the vagus nerve called the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The spinal accessory nerve provides motor innervation to the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles, which are responsible for head, neck, and shoulder movement. To assess the function of the spinal accessory nerve related to the sternocleidomastoid muscle, ask the patient to turn the head to the left. Then ask the patient to turn the head back to midline while applying resistance with one hand. The examination should be performed again on the opposite side. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is specifically responsible for the ability to turn the head to the opposite side. Weakness or inability to turn the head could indicate damage to the spinal accessory nerve. To assess the function of the spinal accessory nerve related to the trapezius muscle, ask the patient to shrug the shoulder toward the ear while you apply downward resistance with one hand. The examination should be performed again on the opposite side weakness on one or both sides is suggestive of a lesion. The hypoglossal nerve provides motor innervation to all muscles of the tongue. To assess the function of the hypoglossal nerve, ask the patient to stick out the tongue. Look for atrophy and fasciculations, as well as deviation toward the left or right side. Deviation of the tongue in either direction is indicative of an ipsilateral nerve lesion. This video has demonstrated the steps involved in the performance of a comprehensive cranial nerve examination. These include obtaining a thorough medical and neurologic history and assessing the function of each cranial nerve through a variety of testing methods. Although a cranial nerve examination may be useful in assessing a patient's neurologic status, advanced imaging studies and referral to neurology or neurosurgery may be required to reach a final diagnosis.
