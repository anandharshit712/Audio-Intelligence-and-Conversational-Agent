**Summary:**

The discussion focused on the treatment options for locally advanced rectal cancer.

**Key Points:**

* **Combination therapy is superior to either chemo radiation or surgery alone.**
* **Long course chemo radiation followed by consolidated fauxfox based systemic therapy is a viable option.**
* **Full furinox may be used in high risk tumors.**
* **Response assessment should be done 4-12 weeks after chemotherapy completion.**
* **Active surveillance may be considered for patients with complete response on MRI, digital exam, and endoscopy.**
* **MSI high status patients can benefit from single agent immune checkpoint inhibitors.**

**Main Discussion Points:**

* The Oprah study findings regarding sequencing of chemo radiation and surgery.
* The importance of MSI high testing before treatment initiation.
* The role of total neoadjuvant treatment in the management of locally advanced rectal cancer.
* The selection of short course versus long course radiation based on risk of recurrence.
* The challenges in defining complete response and the significance of near complete response.

**Conclusion:**

The discussion emphasized the importance of multimodal treatment and personalized selection of therapy options for locally advanced rectal cancer. Early detection of MSI high status and consideration of single agent immune checkpoint inhibitors are key considerations in managing the disease.
