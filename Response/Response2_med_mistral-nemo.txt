Based on the conversation, here's a summary of their approach to treating locally advanced rectal cancer:

1. **Treatment Modality**:
   - They prefer long-course chemoradiation followed by surgery (consolidative) for most patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.
   - In high-risk cases or where organ preservation is desired, they intensify treatment with full-dose fluorouracil and may consider active surveillance after a complete response.

2. **Response Assessment**:
   - They assess response around 8 weeks after chemotherapy completion (range: 4-12 weeks).
   - They use MRI, digital exam, and endoscopy for response assessment.
   - If there's a complete response in all modalities, they consider active surveillance.

3. **Oprah Study Interpretation**:
   - There are differing opinions on the significance of the Oprah study results (a randomized phase II trial) and whether the sequencing of treatment modalities matters.
   - Some physicians still prefer starting with whichever modality can provide relief to the patient most quickly.

4. **MSI High Status**:
   - They emphasize testing for MSI high status, as these patients may respond well to single-agent immune checkpoint inhibitors, potentially decreasing the need for surgery and radiation.
