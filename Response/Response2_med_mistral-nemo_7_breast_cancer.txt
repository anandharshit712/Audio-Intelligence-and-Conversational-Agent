I'm sorry for the confusion, but it seems there's been a misunderstanding. You've shared a transcript about two clinical trials related to breast cancer: KEYNOTE-522 and MONARCHe. However, you haven't specified an "issue" that I can provide detailed information on. Could you please specify the topic or issue you'd like me to address in relation to these trials or breast cancer in general? Here's a brief summary of the two trials mentioned:

1. **KEYNOTE-522:**
   - Pembrolizumab (an anti-PD-1 therapy) combined with chemotherapy was found to significantly improve event-free survival compared to placebo plus chemotherapy in early-stage, high-risk triple-negative breast cancer patients.
   - The benefit was consistent across various subgroups, including those defined by nodal status and overall disease stage.
   - Safety results were consistent with known safety data for pembrolizumab.

2. **MONARCHe:**
   - Adjuvant abemaciclib (a CDK4/6 inhibitor) combined with endocrine therapy led to improved invasive disease-free survival compared to endocrine therapy alone in high-risk, hormone-positive/HER2-negative early breast cancer patients.
   - Ki-67 was an important predictor of response. The FDA approved adjuvant abemaciclib plus endocrine therapy for selected high-risk patients with a Ki-67 level over 20%.
   - ASCO guidelines recommend adjuvant abemaciclib for any patient who would have been eligible for the trial, including those with higher lymph node involvement, larger tumor size, grade three, or high Ki-67.

If you'd like information on specific symptoms, household remedies, recent research findings related to these trials or breast cancer in general, please provide more details so I can assist you better.
