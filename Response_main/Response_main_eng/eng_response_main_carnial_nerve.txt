Here's a summarized version of the comprehensive cranial nerve examination you've described:

1. **Hearing Tests (Cranial Nerves VIII)**
   - Test each ear using whispering or finger rubbing.
   - Perform Weber and Rinne tests for further evaluation:
     - Weber: Place tuning fork on head or nose, observe lateralization in hearing loss.
     - Rinne: Compare bone vs air conductance.

2. **Vestibular Function (Cranial Nerve VIII)**
   - Horizontal Head Impulse Test: Assess eye movements during rapid head rotation to detect vestibular lesions.

3. **Glossopharyngeal and Vagus Nerves Evaluation (Cranial Nerves IX & X)**
   - Assess palate elevation with "ah" sound.
   - Stimulate gag reflex bilaterally.
   - Check for hoarseness, indicating possible recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement.

4. **Spinal Accessory Nerve Evaluation (Cranial Nerve XI)**
   - Head turning against resistance to assess sternocleidomastoid muscle function.
   - Shoulder shrugging against resistance to assess trapezius muscle function.

5. **Hypoglossal Nerve Evaluation (Cranial Nerve XII)**
   - Tongue protrusion to check for atrophy, fasciculations, or deviation towards left/right sides.

6. **Comprehensive Examination**
   - Begin with obtaining a thorough medical and neurological history.
   - Perform these tests in a systematic manner to assess all cranial nerves.
   - Advanced imaging studies and referral to specialists may follow based on findings.
