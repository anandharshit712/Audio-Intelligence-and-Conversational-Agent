 speaker1 : What happens when someone gets a heart attack?
speaker2 : Once that heart stops, there's six minutes within which if you don't start it, you've got brain damage.
speaker1 : Do you think mental health can lead to heart attacks?
speaker2 : Yes. Why are we seeing all these younger guys getting heart attacks? They've amount of stressed and continually depressed to smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Damn.
speaker1 : People understand that it's because of long term smoking, long term alcohol usage, long term usage, perhaps.
speaker2 : I don't think that's the fundamental thing.
speaker1 : What does good marriage add to physical health?
speaker2 : Yes, there's really good evidence that loneliness has a higher risk of death.
speaker1 : Is there any form of exercise that you think is great for the heart?
speaker2 : Every time you do cardio, you're pushing your heart to work harder and create.
speaker1 : New arteries because you've seen heart disease led to death. Do you think that changed you as.
speaker2 : A person going through the post traumatic stress disorder? It's devastating. Should men and women my age go.
speaker1 : Get their heart checked?
speaker2 : Yes, because 20% of patients, they never have symptoms.
speaker1 : People know you are Madhuri Dixit's husband, but there's so much more to you that I think that the Internet is ready for only now. Lots of people may know him as Madhuri Dixit's better half, but I truly believe that the Internet has only just started to understand the greatness of this man, the greatness of our guest today, Doctor Sriram Nene. He is a world renowned cardiac surgeon. He's done more than 5000 procedures when it comes to the heart. And today's conversation is very special, not just from the long term heart health perspective, but we spoke about health in general, the process of aging, how your body is built to deteriorate over time, and what you can do in the now to decelerate that deterioration. So if you're someone who enjoys our health oriented episodes, this one's a treat. Because Doctor Nene has operated in America, he's operated all over the world. And the kind of insight and the kind of articulation that he brings to podcasts is phenomenal. He's going to be back on the show, but this particular episode is only related to heart health. I enjoyed the heck out of speaking to him. I'm sure you're going to learn a lot about how to turn your cardiovascular system as well as your entire system into a healthier version of itself through this episode. It's a very special health oriented episode.
speaker2 : Doctor Nene, sir, welcome to Deon's. Good to be here, bro.
speaker1 : I've been hanging out with you for half an hour and I can finally unleash my personality upon you. Let you unleash your personality upon me. Now we get to speak openly. How are you, sir?
speaker2 : I'm doing great honor to be here, man.
speaker1 : People know that you are Madhuri Dixit's husband and often that's one of the introductions. I've heard about your name in India, but there's so much more to you that I think that the Internet is ready for. Only now you have your YouTube channel, but you have this whole past, which is very elaborate. But I'll tell you what I respect about you the most, that you're really, really fit. And honestly, I've interacted very little with you until this point. But you're genuinely a happy person. So I look up to you for that happiness a lot because you don't see a lot of it in our city. It's just my shallow observation. But you're genuinely in the top one percentile of happy people that I've come across.
speaker2 : So thank you for giving me your time, sir. It's my pleasure. And we have a lot of shared friends and I'm really looking forward to. Huge fan of your work. And you tease the most amazing kind of responses from people and, you know, the conversations we have is almost like it's over Chai and you're coming out with friends who are doing stuff which is meaningful. So I'm looking forward to this. Okay.
speaker1 : How many heart surgeries have you been a part of?
speaker2 : I would say probably 5000 to 10,000 over 20 years. And more than that, I mean, the lives you've got to intervene on and the families and kind of the people that you did, it was very rewarding. And, you know, it was hard. It was really hard because 99.9% of the time everything went perfect. At 0.1%, it would devastate you. You would say, what could you have done differently? Most of the time it's that 30 years of bad living that someone had done to themselves, not knowing, right. It wasn't their fault, no one's fault. But what it did was it devastated not only the patient, but their family. Do you think because you've seen that.
speaker1 : 0.1% where heart disease led to death, do you think that changed you as a person?
speaker2 : Yeah, I think every. So look, I'm a sports guy and you want to win every game, right? And I've been playing sports my whole entire life. And I see the camaraderie increase. And similar to that, heart surgery is all about teams, 80 people coming together, ten in the oR, another ten in the ICU or more than that. Your floors, everything to try to get one patient through. And when something doesn't happen the way you planned it, it's devastating. And I think, you know, that sort of post traumatic stress disorder is something many people in healthcare live with, but also in police work, in fire department, even in a lot of areas. My point being that I think it's very important to take everything you have not for granted and every minute you have on this earth, because everything else is fungible. Time is not. It's something that doesn't come back. Money will come and go, you know, everyone hopefully will have enough to eat, a roof over their head, something to drive if they want, and the ability to kind of interact. But what matters in the end is family and friends coming together and creating experiences and the moments that you spend together. So time is the real enemy here.
speaker1 : Firstly, because you're a heart surgeon, and this is something I probably realized over the course of exercising for all these years. The logic behind doing cardio is to give your cardiovascular system exercise, and effectively, it is the most central part of your fitness, according to me, as a human. Fair to say that, yeah. All the other stuff, the big muscles, spine health, gut health, it's all important. But first and foremost, take care of your heart.
speaker2 : I love how you're thinking once that heart stops, there's six minutes within which, if you don't start it, you've got brain damage. Right. But the bigger part of that is when you're working out a muscle. Right. And the heart's an interesting organ in that it has not just pumping muscle muscular capacity, it has its own conduction system and its own circulation system.
speaker1 : Conduction system.
speaker2 : So we've got nerves which basically allow the heart to beat and synchronize the upper chambers of the heart and the lower chambers of the heart. And the idea is that when that goes awry, you can have issues. And in the case of ischemia or bad blood flow, some parts of that congestion system can again interrupt it, and you can go into something called ventricular fibrillation or arrest. Something we were working on was potentially putting something called these emds into all of the public places. So in the US, you have these things where they can shock people out of these aberrant rhythms and.
speaker1 : Hold on, I gotta simplify everything that you just.
speaker2 : Yeah, sure.
speaker1 : So you sweat basically, for a heart to beat and pump. There's nerves attached to it.
speaker2 : Yes.
speaker1 : So it's kind of like the wiring of the machine.
speaker2 : Yes.
speaker1 : And something can go wrong with the wiring, which can lead to a heart attack.
speaker2 : So what happens? It's the opposite, that when you have the heart attack, it affects the neurologic system and also. So let's back up a minute. Sure. 17.5 lakh people die of heart disease that we know about in India, right. Globally, it's 17.5 million. It's the number one affliction for the whole world. Right. And the interesting part is it trumps all the other diseases which we know about. Right. Cancer, diabetes, hypertension, all that. With diabetes, heart disease is a complication. Right. So the thing about heart disease is if we can prevent early, recognize an early treat, then the outcomes will be far superior. Now, let's fast forward a little bit that. What is heart disease? Well, the arteries on the heart, the one we're talking about, coronary artery disease, will build up plaques over time in some patients. Not all, but in some patients who either have aberrant processing of lipids, so they have high cholesterol and deposition of that, or alternatively, they have other reasons causing that. Interesting. Cholesterol is a mixed, as you know, that for primary prevention, we don't necessarily use it unless you have serious risk factors for heart disease.
speaker1 : Can we actually boil it down to the basics? First, how do you explain to a five year old about what the heart does for the human body?
speaker2 : Sure. So the heart basically pumps blood, which has oxygen in it, to basically power all of your other tissues. Got it.
speaker1 : Then once your tissues use up that blood, your blood gets deoxygenated.
speaker2 : It does. And then the heart is still pumping, and that blood basically is in a circuit. It goes through the lungs, and the lungs will exchange the CO2 and all the other things out to the air, and you'll get oxygen in it. At the same time, the heart's also pumping that blood to your brain, which obviously runs the show to some degree with your thinking as well as your autonomic function, meaning your basic functions for all of your nerves, and then finally to your kidneys and your other organs, the liver, to detoxify your blood, and the kidneys to basically pull out any metabolic excretion artifacts and then excrete them through the urine. And so it's a critical piece to the machinery. Without the heart, you won't move.
speaker1 : So the veins in your body send the deoxygenated blood to the lungs. The lungs.
speaker2 : Well, so first it comes back to the heart. Right, and then the heart, the right side of the heart pumps, the right atrium collects it, the right ventricle pumps it into your lungs. The lungs deoxygenate that blood, and then it sends it to the left heart, to the left atrium, and to the left ventricle. And the left ventricle pumps, and it goes through the aorta to the rest of the body.
speaker1 : Its main role is to just shoot the blood into the rest of your.
speaker2 : That's right. Body. That's right. And to collect it and detoxify it and present it again and again and again in your lifetime. 125 million bees or whatnot.
speaker1 : When someone gets a heart attack, effectively, what's happening?
speaker2 : So the heart has its own circulation system. And what happens is that there may be a blockage in one of the three main arteries or in the left main, which doesn't allow blood to flow to part of the muscle and all the tissues involved. When that happens, that muscle or that area basically will stop working. And that's when you get into trouble, right. That's when you have the chest pain radiating to your arm, the shortness of breath, the sweatiness, the palpitations. Interesting part. In 20% of patients, they never have symptoms. And so in those patients, they may have indigestion, they may have back pain, they may have something else. And that's most often the case with diabetics. Diabetics, glucose or sugar coats in their nerves. And so even in their feet, they may have numbness and end up with foot ulcers. But in the heart, it's very, very interesting in that the diabetic patients often present late. Similarly, for whatever reason, in women, a lot of times they'll have atypical symptoms, or they will discount the symptoms because moms and women in general are heartier than men, in my opinion. And so they don't come in until very late. And so while men get heart attacks more often than women, even though it's a 50 50 kind of breakdown, when women get heart attacks, they're liable to succumb to them twice as often. This was a study in 2023 in the European Union.
speaker1 : Why do they show up at the hospital if they don't have symptoms?
speaker2 : So that's the question, right? That they have some symptoms which are atypical. And in the case where people have no symptoms at all, they collapse. They can have a cardiac arrest, or they can have fainting, or they can just not feel good biologically.
speaker1 : What's happening for them?
speaker2 : To faint. So you have no blood flow to the brain. Right. Gotcha. And so you have a sinkable episode potential, or you have your heart not pumping at all with a very fast heart rhythm, and none of that blood is going to rest.
speaker1 : Little morbid question, but if someone dies because of a heart attack, is there a possibility that that death could be painless?
speaker2 : Wow, that's a tough one. Depends, right? I mean, it depends on how fast it goes down. But if you have no blood flow. Yes. But leading up to that, I tell my people that there's fates worse than that, because if you survive that heart attack and end up with a gimpy heart or any type of neurologic symptoms or kidney shutdown or whatever, you will suffer with that for a longer period of time. So where I'm going with this is you can have silent ischemia and die in your sleep. That's where you're going with this. But I would say the majority of people don't have that. They suffer before they die, and there is a way to prevent that.
speaker1 : Biologically, they suffer because your heart stopped pumping blood. Now, that part of your body, they're.
speaker2 : Not just stopping, but it can decrease flow where it's a low flow state. And so you don't feel good, you're cyanotic, kidneys aren't working very well. There's other issues.
speaker1 : So it's kind of like secondary damage.
speaker2 : To the other organs. That's right.
speaker1 : Which is way worse for your life.
speaker2 : Post the heart attack. Yes, yes. And so you never want to be in that position. You know, I was talking about this on my Twitter feed, and I said, look, everyone wants to be invulnerable. When you're in your twenties, most of us thinking, can't touch, I can do anything. And what you don't recognize is you're taking hits every day. And later, when you're looking on the other side, you've got a heart disease or cancer or something like that, you can never go back. That's what I spent most of my career doing. That. In the nick of time, we would come in, bypass corneres or replace valve, do something, intervene, and 99.9% of the time, we could save that person. But you couldn't turn back the clock. And so, like it or not, the next ten years of their life would depend on their habits and whether we could undo that, number one. And number two, sometimes they did everything right. Their genetics were bad. And listen, there's never an evening in my book, we all support each other. Everyone is beautiful. You have to be there for you. But the key is that if we can intervene earlier and get this awareness up that this is a deal. You and I can talk to people and say, look, I'm not doing it to preach to you, and I'm not telling you how to live your life, but I care about you, and I want you with me for 100 years to have fun. Let's pick and choose what battles to fight, and let's not take shots, because the problem is peer pressure is high, right. And people will do stuff because it looks great. It's extrinsic motivation. It's like Instagram moment, but they don't realize is 1020 years from now, they'll be painful.
speaker1 : Could you expand a little bit on these instagrammable moments that lead to heart.
speaker2 : Attacks in the long term, are you.
speaker1 : Basically talking about, like, drinking and smoking?
speaker2 : Yeah, drinking and smoking, eating whatever you want, anytime you want. And, you know, I'm a total su. That's. Or you. And the issue is I've had to reel back because my, you know, familial diabetic genes and cholesterol genes and all the other stuff which we have in India, I will get the best of me if I don't take care. Right? And my dad is 85. We reversed his diabetes using some of our protocols at 80, and he's doing better, but I can't undo 55 years of living. And so my problem is that he still has to suffer. He's doing great. I have to give it to him. He stayed disciplined and focused, and we were able to get him off all his best. Now he's back on a few of them just to protect his kidneys. But kidneys in that Vetus take a pretty big hit long term. And so this is something, you know, where you can prevent all. If you learn about this early and kind of choose your battles.
speaker1 : Coming back to health. Had to just mention that. Okay. While explaining the heart attack situation, you spoke about plaque.
speaker2 : Yeah.
speaker1 : Now, of course, people understand that it's because of long term smoking, long term alcohol usage, long term drug usage, perhaps.
speaker2 : I don't think that's the fundamental thing. Those accentuate all of that. There are risk factors, independent risk factors, particularly smoking and even some of the other things. I think it's a combination of genetics and lifestyle. And then, you know, when I say lifestyle, I'm talking diet, exercise, all of that stuff.
speaker1 : Sleep.
speaker2 : Sleep. You know, I talked in one of my podcasts about the five things I think are essential. Right. And sleep is way up. It's your protective cocoon. And I'll tell you, a lot of people take it for granted. But it's somewhere where you rejuvenate and your brain defrags. I mean, I did an excellent series on sleep with a sleep specialist, and he taught me so much about sleep, and I didn't know that much. And I have all these trackers that we use, and what I found is, it's clear, your memory, your long term memories, are saved when you sleep. And if you don't have sleep, there's numerous studies on sleep deprivation which show you can't form new memories, right. And let alone the fact that your body needs to assimilate all the proteins and the tissues need to kind of repopulate. There's certain tissues that grow fast, like the gut and buccal mucosa, the stuff inside your mouth, your intestines, and stuff like that. And there's stuff which has a long game to it. And sleep is one of those things that helps it work. Water. Believe it or not, it's so hot right now. We're in the middle of summer, right? And we talked about this on the channel that, yes, there's these ballpark rules, right? 3.7 liters for males, 2.7 liters for females. But it's not that simple. And the bottom line is, you got to keep up with your water intake, decrease on your caffeine intake so that you don't diaries yourself, meaning make yourself pee all the time. And if you do that, I assure you, drinking enough water is one solution which you will find very, very, very effective.
speaker1 : Related to heart health, 100%. Okay, we got to break this down a lot more. What you said about sleep and erasing the ability to create new memories, for me, it's basically like your parts of your brain kind of dying almost.
speaker2 : No, not so simple. What happens is, every day, you're faced with a lot of information, right? And it's stored kind of in short term bursts, right. At nighttime, the theory is that that all gets organized and permanently stored. So if you think about putting it in technology terms, a hard drive, right? When you defrag a hard drive, it basically takes all the rubbish out, and then it organizes blocks, and that's what happens during sleep. And particularly in REM sleep, you know, rapid eye movement sleep, you are doing that very effectively. And so if you don't have REM sleep, it's also been shown that your memory formation is great, and you're basically, in my estimation, I think you're reliving your memories while you're sleeping, and they're getting organized, but it's not your brain dying, because the neurons are still there. There are other things which kill your brain. Right? But that doesn't kill it. There's theories that 90% of your brain is not used. You're only using 10%. I think it's that simple. But the idea is the brain is very plastic, and you can reorganize with. This was shown in people who have had strokes. And in those patients, very interestingly, they can use other parts of their brain and relearn for six weeks to six months. And so what you see is not what you get in stroke, right? First, you know, three days, the brain swells. Then after that, for six weeks, the scar tissue is healing, and your ischemic penumbra, where the poor blood flow was, is improving. And then from six weeks to six months, it remodeled. And during that remodeling phase, that's when the plasticity of the brain will allow you to kind of relearn things, and you can potentially rehabilitate a pain. Some things can't change. And similarly, in the heart, it's the same way that when you've had a heart attack, that tissue that's dying has a window, right? And it will form permanent scar. The key is heart as a muscle, to be effective, has to have enough muscle in order to pump blood efficiently to your body. Now, the interesting part, and this is where the cardio comes. And back to that. Every time you do cardio, you're pushing your heart to work harder, and you're building the intrinsic circulation system. And in places where your flow may not be perfect or let's say you have a plaque, the heart, so long as you do it in a very definitive manner, will adapt and create new artists, neovascularization, and sort of bypass those routes. And. And so what happens is your quote, unquote, ischemic conditioning your heart, we create new arties. Create or make those channels bigger. It's like if you have a road in Anthony, right? And you get a blockage in that road, what do you do? You go around it. That's similar to what happens in heart, that the harder you push and the more traffic going through in the way of blood cells, it will figure out another way around. Now that muscle gets stronger. And in the most amazing athletes, it's quite interesting because their resting heart rate is very, very low. Their muscle is so efficient that it can pump the same amount of blood that you and I do with a higher heart rate. So pumping is all about heart rate times stroke volume. Stroke volume is the amount of fluid you have in. So if you alter either one of those pumping capacitors. We were talking about water just then. If you're dehydrated, your stroke volume's down, so your heart has to beat at a heart higher rate. Similarly, if you get a gunshot and your blood is down, your heart rate will go up because you have less volume. Right. And so that's how they all kind of play into each other. And it's all physiology, right? It's all biologic processes 101. As a heart surgeon, you had to know all of that. So, quite interesting.
speaker1 : I want to talk about plaque again. Okay, so you're saying that the basis of it is a combination of genetic factors, lifestyle factors, that's about it.
speaker2 : Not as simple, but in the genetics, there's a couple of things. Why is it that some people are either predestined or have a very strong own family history of heart disease, and other people can eat whatever they want and get away with it? You know, they talked about a mediterranean diet, they talked about parts of France where they never got heart disease. As we're doing more and more studies, what we're finding, and there was an epic study on Crestor, which looked at cholesterol for twelve years, and Crestor is a drug which reduces cholesterol. And what they found was at the end of the twelve years for primary prevention. So let me back up. At some point, if you had high cholesterol, everyone was on some type of anti cholesterol medication. I don't want to use brands, but the point is, HMD CoA reductase is the broad category of what they were. And so what would happen is we would all go to maximum lipid lowering, thinking that that was what caused heart disease in everyone.
speaker1 : Mean, lesser fat in food, lesser fat.
speaker2 : Was the first thing. Then in addition to that, if you on your physicals, when you hit 40, 50, whatever, they check your blood and the cholesterol is up immediately, everyone go on a stat, right?
speaker1 : Go deeper into cholesterol. Like, what is cholesterol? What is ldl, hdl, just so that people.
speaker2 : Yeah, so, so this is gonna get very technical fast, but, um. And remember, I'm a cardiac surgeon, so real experts are the cardiologist. But anyway, the way cholesterol works is it's used by your body to make hormones, estrogen, testosterone, all of that. It's also used in building blocks, right? But it's also, you know, taken from fat and all the other stuff. Now, what happens is with cholesterol in its worst phase, when you get a tissue injury in the coronary arteries where the blood pressure's up or you get scar forming, the first response is white cells go in and then that area basically takes on cholesterol. As those tissues die, the plaques are actually tombstones of the cells. Right. You know what a tombstone is? Right? So that's the calcium plaque. And so dead bodies of wbcs. No, the dead body of those endothelial cells. Endothelial cells are the lining of the artery. And so when they get damaged to repair, the normal system is you'll get white platelets and white cells going in to repair that. But in patients who have high cholesterol, the cholesterol can also be deposited there in the right setting. Right. The interesting part is why don't everyone get. Now they talk about HDL, good cholesterol and ldl, bad cholesterol. LDL and VLDL are very sticky. They tend to stick to the arteries. HDL is a scavenger and it will actually protect you. Hdl goes up when you exercise. LDL, by comparison, go up if you have the wrong sort of genetics, or alternatively, if you're eating a lot of high fat and not. Is that a bad thing? So in. In patients who have documented risk factors for heart disease, first degree relative, who has had a heart attack or died of heart disease, and in particular, if they're less than 50 very high risk factors, four to ten fold higher than basically, then you can look at diabetes. Diabetic patients are at a higher risk for heart disease. If the patient themselves have had a heart episode, heart attack, or they have significant coronary art disease, those guys have risk factors. Hypertension, high blood pressure is a silent kidney because you get very high pressures which cause injury to the arteries. And from that you can get cholesterol laxation. Smoking is an independent risk factor, which from the nicotine as well as the 2000 other byproducts, will increase your risk of heart disease and actually make it accelerate. Right. So if you have these primary risk factors, then in that patient with a high cholesterol, you would put someone on a statin. On a statin, on either a statin or another type of cholesterol reducing medication, and that you have to consult your local doctor, your cardiologist or your GP, because it needs to be monitored, and you got to make sure that you don't get complications. But in this crestor study, what they showed is that primary prevention is not there in unless you have primary risk factors for us. So after that study, people kind of got a little more lax about cholesterol and said that it's not a single variable equation. There's multiple variables which are cause and hertz.
speaker1 : So that basically what that statement meant is that if you have high cholesterol levels in your bloodstream, it doesn't mean you're necessarily prone to heart disease.
speaker2 : That's right. In the context of someone with primary risk factors, the ones we mentioned there, you would definitely pay attention if your cholesterol is super high, your ldl super high. And, you know, because the other problem, this is an interesting one, but India has no one all cause mortality.
speaker1 : What is that?
speaker2 : So, in the US, every time someone passes, it's recorded in and, you know, collected public. In India, if. If you pass in a nursing home or at home or whatever, they don't necessarily collect data in one count. So the 17 and a half lakhs people talk about, we don't know if that's the actual number or not, someone might die and they never do an autopsy, right? So we don't know if they died of heart disease. Could be of anything, right? They could have died of malaria. And so the problem with that is, unless you know why people are succumbing, you can't treat them.
speaker1 : If you don't know what the disease.
speaker2 : Is, how are you going to come up with a solution? Why I'm saying that is India now has Ayushman Bharat, which is this plumbing layer which we built. I was part of ispirit, and they handed it to the government. And on that, like, they also created Aadhaar and UPI, meaning that they had this system where you could plop on all of the other apps so you could keep track of it and fundamentally digitally pass information. Take a step back and think about the record keeping, which is not done in India. You have this little bag of goodies that you walk around with, and no one really knows what that patient has until they see him again and they have to go through all the records. Now, imagine a system which you're trying to build, where everything is continuous, end to end, and you get healthcare, in a nutshell, on an active dashboard, and you basically bring everything for each patient, personalized. Then all of a sudden, I can intervene in real time and say, look, we should not be doing this kind of stuff with you because you're going to get into trouble, right? And it can go even farther without being intrusive. But you can look at what they're eating. If they give us that information, right, we can look at their exercise routines, we can look at what the relationships are and the stressors they have, we can intervene at any point that they ask us to. But at the same time, until recently, even in the US and globally, record keeping was not there. It was owned by one organization or another, not universal. So that's one place where we're trying to intervene, which India has done so well with the yoga. Now, as that builds up, that'll be interesting. And from that, we will be ten years ahead of anyone on the planet. But what will happen is all of a sudden, your fingerprint data, your iris data, will be your key to your personalized healthcare, and that becomes powerful. So now you're talking about cholesterol and flax and all that. I'm looking at a bigger landscape. I'm no longer the heart surgeon. I'm the healthcare influencer and innovator who's trying to change how medicine is practiced on a planet. That means I to have it not just evolution, but revolution. We need to change how things happen, because the business of medicine cannot guide the practice. And it needs to be led in a way where the biggest shareholder is the patient.
speaker1 : This whole loop that we're in the middle of was about plaque. Act like the overarching theme. Then we went into genetics and lifestyle. I'm still not completely clear on what causes the blockages. I understand it's scar tissue in a way, right?
speaker2 : Yeah.
speaker1 : As well as cholesterol that goes in deposits.
speaker2 : Yeah. And then. So the way it works is that you'll have an injury to the endothelium from high blood pressure, or just the heart pumping heart. That injury will be repaired by white cells to the endothelium. And during the process of that, if your cholesterol lipids are high in the right patients, that lipid will go in with the injury. Sometimes the cell will die, and the calcium then, which gets deposited there, is what we call the plaque. Now, here's the tricky part. And when it becomes harmful, that plaque can then go on to rupture. And when it ruptures, let's say you have high blood pressure or you're exerting yourself and the narrowing in your artery. So two things can happen. One is, as the plaque gets bigger and bigger, the lumen or the inside of that artery, the diameter gets smaller and smaller, and it becomes a flow issue. And, you know, at 75% blockage, you're blocking 90% of the flow to that artery, and that's when your muscle gets starved with blood flow. So that's one mechanism, second one, which is more acute and where you see it in sudden death, or even in heart attacks, is when that plaque ruptures. And then you get a platelet pump. So the normal response to a rupture or an injury in an artery or a hand or anywhere, right? Is that the endothelium, the inside of the artery, and then some of the other components are exposed, and there's naturally occurring elements in your blood, thrombin, antithrombin, and all these which get activated, and with that, platelets stick to it, and they cause a clot, and that plugs up the hole. So in this case, when the plaque ruptures, you don't necessarily have a true home. But if that plaque ruptures, then the platelet sticking to that can cause clot, which completely blocks out. So now you went from a narrowing to a complete blockage. And when that happens, you get a catastrophic decrease in blood. Boom. To the muscle affected. And with that, depending on what's with the muscle, if it's no tissue like a conduction system, or if it's other tissues in that area, you get a heart attack.
speaker1 : With someone like yourself, 57, you're very healthy. You take care of yourself. Is plaque still building up in your heart?
speaker2 : 100%. And so let's qualify that, right? There are people who have gone to 80 and nineties, never have any, because for some reason, their body's system of scavenging and processing the lipids is such that they don't have a lot of sticky lipids, if you will. For whatever reason, those people don't have primary risk factors for heart disease, and you'll never see them having heart attacks in others. Right. In kind of the indian subcontinent. There was a good study in 2003, which looked at young men, and this was a topic on my channel, that why are we seeing all these younger guys getting heart attacks? And for one thing, our ldl processing is aberrant, in many cases, genetically. And then the second part of that equation is stress is high, always. Right. And then the third part of that equation is perhaps our arteries are smaller than our nordic counterparts, who are, like, six foot five and burly. Right. And so the combination of those things leads to narrowing much more prematurely, I think, versus. I mean, this was described in 2003, 2004 in the annals, and I don't think that the incidence has gone up as much as us recognizing the incidents through our media and social media and other things. Every week, every week I turn around and someone has succumbed to a heart attack or had a heart attack. It might be a driver, it might be a relative, might be someone you work with. What not? I'm hearing it way too often, and it's preventable potential. So back to what you were asking, will I have? Well, the interesting part is I do whole body scans, and I wouldn't necessarily recommend them as standard. In fact, I think about how you should get medicine is very focused to what your needs are. They should look at your medical history, your past, your family history, your social history, and look at what your risk factors are for disease, and then order any type of corroborative tests. And you know what we were taught back in the eighties, in the nineties, when I was going through med school and whatnot, it was very clear that 80% of your diagnosis was made through history and physical, and 20% were corroborative testing. Now it's turned to a system where it's the tail wagging dog, where we often get the studies first and then see our patients after that. Many reasons that occurs, that they do.
speaker1 : The test first and then understand the past. Yeah, it's important to know the past of the patient.
speaker2 : And then, according to guides, you alternately, you have these huge packages they now offer where they give you this battery of lab tests and, you know, whole body scans and this that. I don't think you should be exposed to radiation unless you need it or if there's a risk factor for it. Right. Does it help knowing early? Maybe in a few cases. I mean, just as an aside, this you'll find interesting. In the nineties, CT scanners came on the c and back then, trying to get a CT scan, you had to book it a week in advance. Crazy stuff. But what ended up happening is we would find a lot of incidental loads. These were lumps and bumps and tissue, which we thought might be worrisome. We didn't know how to interpret the data. The same thing's happening now with these watches and other things. We get a lot of data we don't know how to interpret. What ended up happening as those incidentalomas came into being is a lot of patients went through relatively unnecessary surgery and they had these things removed because we were worried that they might have tumor, this, that, and the other. Come to find out that in most cases, that's not why people would pass away. Right. And so the technology should not be dictating treatment. It should be your clinical acumen, which should guide the technology, and that should be your corroboration. Should men and women my age go.
speaker1 : Get their heart check?
speaker2 : So how old are you now? 31. Okay. I would say no unless you have a risk factor. Laden history.
speaker1 : You mean like if my relatives are high or.
speaker2 : No. So I would say at 31, I wouldn't recommend it. If you have a good exercise tolerance, you're healthy, and if all your other factors are there, you don't have any symptoms, meaning shortness of breath, chest pain, chest pressure, or inability to exercise. There's no reason to be doing that stuff. In fact, I would instead vote to observe you and kind of, you know, risk, stratify you in terms of what your risk is for disease and then modify your risk factors. Right. Why should I intervene on you? If you don't need it, you don't have an incident. I think that's useless. I think that you're not. You're scaring someone, number one. And number two, just because you have that test doesn't mean five years from now, you couldn't have that. So I would say the better part of that is to teach you lifestyle governing steps and also how does disease operates in your particular situation. And then the hope would be long term that I can create awareness for you and your family as a group to look after each other.
speaker1 : Fair to say that one of your key questions as a heart doctor would be to get to know the person's routine. What's your lifestyle? What's your routine? How much do you exercise? Etcetera?
speaker2 : Yep.
speaker1 : Is there any form of exercise that you think is great for the heart?
speaker2 : So many studies have shown that cardiovascular or cardio is beneficial. You're pushing your heart to perform. But having said that, look, what are the components to heart disease, right? What are the stress? So I would say, for me, yoga helps, too. Too. And there's no, you know, qualitative measure that if you do this, that happens. But what there is is that if your heart is trained, in the case of cardiovascular fitness, right. Or alternatively, you can de stress yourself. These are all independent risk factors for disease.
speaker1 : If you can de stress yourself, yes. Okay.
speaker2 : Easy, right? To say, hard to do.
speaker1 : I've been doing yoga based stretches for about two years now. My first observation after my first intense yoga session was that I felt great from a mental perspective. I was just feeling very relaxed biologically. What happened or what happens in these deep stretching sessions, according to you as a doctor, why do you get these stress?
speaker2 : I don't know if there's evidence which is mechanistic on that. And to answer your question, I don't know if there's a clear cut answer on this. Let's qualify that, right? That if you're clearing your mind of all of this and distracting yourself from everything that's happening around you, all the stressors you might have gone to, right, bills, you know, your workflow, everything you need to do is gone. You're just in the exercise, you're in the space. Right? That can happen a lot of ways. I did spin this morning and I can tell you, every time I do spin, I come out of there, I'm so happy because there's loud punjabi music and all your buddies with you cheering each other on, and it really pulls you away from any type of complications you might face. So some of it is how you deal with your own life now, mechanistically. Has anyone proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that yoga will prevent heart disease? I've not seen this disease. Perhaps they exist, but for me personally and for you as well, does it relax me? Yeah. And it also, I've always said that above a certain age, five things need to be adopted. One is cardiovascular fitness, then the other parts of this equation are going to be diet and all of the other things which you do. But I, I would say balance, gait, cardiovascular fitness and flexibility are kind of the four things which I look for, particularly for me and also for you, and you take them for granted until you can't do something with back injuries.
speaker1 : Why flexibility? Because this is something I didn't pay attention to in my twenties, paid the price of my late twenties to sports injuries, and then I realized few yoga sessions basically prevented me from all the injuries that I was getting on a regular basis.
speaker2 : So I'll tell you something for men in particular, as you go 30, 40, 50, flexibility goes down here even more. Yes. Because the bottom line is you're not stretching, you're not working out. You see the men with their little 40 year old paunch in India, and it's partly that, you know, in our teens and twenties, where we can do anything, our metabolism is high enough, you can burn the calories and you eat like a hog, basically, and you're working out, right, then you get a job, you might get married, you have kids, and you have responsibilities. And the only source of kind of de stressing is these social gatherings where invariably you're either eating or drinking. And so this 40 year old punched. And I think the healthier alternative would be to come together and do some kind of sporting activity or go out and go walking or do something simple. It doesn't have to be expensive or complicated. It can be something very simple. That's one thing. The second thing is for flexibility. A lot of I had the same issue with my back. A lot of your back. This is your front. You can have a punch, so you have to drop that. But the other part is, I was so taught in the hamstrings and the glutes and all that were not strong enough. And earlier they were, because I ran cross country, I did everything. But as I developed further and further along, I was getting out of those hams, so I had to rehabilitate my core. And most of the time with backs, you can do physical therapy and not require an operation. And believe me, the things you'll take for granted in your life will come back to haunt you. Those are necks, backs, knees and shoulders. Those four areas will haunt you later. So with the flexibility, you're kind of preventing yourself from not having those issues. The other thing it helps you with is situations where you have to sit low chairs or, you know, cars or things like that. Without that flexibility, you may fall. You may have other issues. I was talking to some octogenarians and seventies and 80 year olds, and what I found with them is they're already at a. At a serious disadvantage, particularly in women, sometimes with osteoporosis or osteopenia.
speaker1 : What's this?
speaker2 : The second? So, osteopenia is low bone density. Osteoporosis is where it's actually debilitated. It can increase your fracture risk if you fall. Right. And those patients in particular, those four things which we talked about, the cardiovascular resilience, the flexibility, their gait and their balance, those four things they adhered to, they didn't get into trauma. Because if you fall in an 80 year old on a hip or something, that can be a life changer or an even end of life.
speaker1 : End of life how?
speaker2 : End of life? Because the complications you get from the hip surgery and being sedentary for a period of time and all of that have been shown to have consequences. Blood clots, this, that, and the other. And also getting them back to their life becomes challenging. Nowadays, if they're discovered early and operated and taken care of, generally we can save them. But imagine, is that true in all of India? No, it's not. Maybe in the burbs in South Bombay or something like that. Not everyone has access in time, right? Do you remember when we were on.
speaker1 : The same flight together?
speaker2 : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
speaker1 : Then when you were leaving, I gave.
speaker2 : You a sports icon. Yeah. Yeah.
speaker1 : My first thought was, whoa, that's a firm handshake. So I always wanted to tell you you're a strong guy.
speaker2 : Thank you.
speaker1 : The thing is that strength is an outcome of your weight training, I'm assuming.
speaker2 : A little bit of that. But I also played racket spins, right. So I grip his hands for, like, oh, God, you know, because you had to hold these doggone rackets and play, you know, with a balls and stuff.
speaker1 : Like that with osteoporosis and osteopenia.
speaker2 : Yeah.
speaker1 : Is the long term solution something related to strength and sports?
speaker2 : Again? So it's a great question. In women in particular, you have to build up your whole calcium, store up to about 40, 50 pre menopausal. Right. So they have to hit the vitamin d three, which is a huge issue, India, as well as the calcium. And then after menopause, once their estrogen levels and all that go down, it's very hard to metabolize and to store all of that. And so if they're already osteopenic by 50 because they haven't had adequate vitamin D three in calcium stores, then as they get older, it can get worse. And, you know, I'm sure you know this, but bones are continuously building and breaking. They have osteoblasts, which are these cells, which make it, and osteoclasts, which break it down. But they're continuously building, and it happens because of the physical pressures and forces that are exerted on. So now think about that in context with the question that if you're working out and doing exercise, you're putting forces on these bones which cause them to take up calcium and get strengthened. And so you're absolutely right on that. If you're physically active, the likelihood of you building up bone is much higher. Now, there's one thing that once you get older and you've been identified with some types of osteoporosis and osteoporosis, and your doctor has obsessed with this, you sometimes need adjuncts because they'll grow you on what your risk of fracture is if you fall and if it's really high. In those cases, sometimes we need to act and give you medications which either decrease the bone resorption, block the osteoclast activity, or they increase the osteoblastic activity or the building. And in those cases, if you're identified early, it can potentially prevent a hip fracture or other things.
speaker1 : It's a medicine that it creates the osteoblasts.
speaker2 : No, it'll be for osteoclasts usually, but it's for resorption, and it basically makes everything stick. But we're going way too far into the weeds.
speaker1 : Okay.
speaker2 : Yeah. Yeah.
speaker1 : The same question about weight training and sports, especially for women. So you said that. D three and calcium up till the point of menopause.
speaker2 : I'm saying even beyond that. But the idea is estrogen is a mitigator, right. It's a hormone which causes many things. And so even for heart disease, actually, postmenopausal women have a higher risk of heart disease because estrogen is down. And so, very interesting stuff with the hormones. And I'll tell you, that's one area. Brain science, neuroscience with hormonal balances, serotonin, dopamine, all that. We don't know half of the stuff that we need functionally, mechanistically. And so a little bit of a tangent, but mental health, such a big problem, which is so understated.
speaker1 : Alternate question. Do you think mental health can lead to heart attacks, a lack of mental health?
speaker2 : So, yes and no. Is there any direct connection? I would say to you that if you're struggling, stressed, and continually depressed and doing two things, one is it increases your stress hormones. Right. We know that. And second thing is it may also worsen your habits. You may get into drinking, you may binge eat, you may do other things. So the answer is indirectly, yes. Have they ever qualifiably shown that people with mental health have worse heart disease? I've not seen. This may exist, but I've not seen it. Right. But you can think about it mechanistically, that it could be the case.
speaker1 : Little deeper question.
speaker2 : Sure.
speaker1 : All your patients, people you operated upon, amongst them, there were some you had very deep conversations with pre surgery. Did they have sad lives before that? Or the they have a sad outlook on life.
speaker2 : Interesting. You know, it's always a tough one because you don't know what came first, chicken or the egg. That because they had heart disease and they had to go through an operation, do all that, were they sad or were they just depressed to begin with? Right. And I'm not convinced that depression was a key pre existing symptoms. I would say that any type of physical ailment can give you depression. I mean, think about it, right? It's traumatizing and you feel bad, and the physical illness can do that. The good news with what we did, and one of the reasons why I like doing heart surgery was that in many cases, if you're doing valve replacement or coronary artery bypass, you could effectively not cure but fix their underlying physical ailments. Right. And they would go on with time to lead pretty substantial lives. There were exceptions and cases which came very late or you had a lot of damage or things like that. The problem was the recidivism, meaning how often did these people come back? Right. And you're familiar with stents, the things they put through the arteries and do that through cardiology.
speaker1 : Tiny bite.
speaker2 : Yeah. They're little metal scaffolds that they inflate and they balloon angioplasty blockage. So there's patients who, if you have one vessel or two vessels or limited disease, you would use stents. Generally, the patients who were with three vessel disease or with left main syndrome. The long term studies show that heart surgery is better, and also in diabetics it's probably better, but in some cases, they would need to be stented to save their lives, and then we would come back and bypass them later. So where I was going with this is that in those patients, could you effectively prevent them from needing another stent? And most of the data with Stent suggests that they would need more procedures in a ten year period than if you had a heart bypass. Now, even heart bypasses, the arteries, which we use 90% of the time, are open. You'll have to slow down. Sure.
speaker1 : Talking about cardiac surgery, you have to first classify cardiac surgery.
speaker2 : Okay, so let's back up a second. So. So let's say you came to me with chest pain. Yeah. We took you to the lab. So how would this happen? You come in with chest pain. They diagnose you with a heart attack. The next step is if you have the ability, you would go to the cath lab, potentially, which is a lab and which has a big radiology meter, and then they put a catheter in and with dye, they map out your heart rates. Right. And where the blockages are. If it's one or two arteries like we were talking about, you could potentially stent them if they're in the right locations. Right. In cases where you have three vessel disease or left main disease, there's three major vessels on the heart. If all three were affected, then putting in stents in them, a, risky, but b, also doesn't carry the long term benefits that heart surgeries.
speaker1 : So either you replace some of the pipes or if it's a more extreme.
speaker2 : Situation, so you don't replace them. Right. What you're doing is opening them up and putting a scaffold in. But the problem is that scaffold can have closure with time and more often with scaffolding stents. Right. Now, let's say you're not a candidate for stents. Then you would refer someone to a surgeon. And what the surgeon would do typically is through an incision in the middle of the chest, they would either do it off pump or on pump. So off pump means that we would stabilize your heart. We would take a conduit, which is a piece of pipe, either. What it means is you take a vein, you reverse it, and you hook it up to the big vessel coming off the heart, and then you hook it up to the artery beyond the blockage, hold on.
speaker1 : To place a stent, you don't need a surgeon.
speaker2 : You do. But it's only a needle stick.
speaker1 : That's it?
speaker2 : Yes. Okay.
speaker1 : And the open heart surgery is more.
speaker2 : Serious, it's more involved. Right. The recovery time is longer, whatnot. But the long term patency and durability of it. Higher. Right. And so in the select patients, in the right patients, it's the appropriate thing. If you just have one or two vessels that are easily stentable, they can stent them, knowing that you may have to revisit it in three years, five years, you modify their risk factors, and honestly, it's less of a do than doing an open heart. But in the cases where it's substantial disease and a diabetic or something like that, heart surgery would be a better option because long term, the durability of that would be higher.
speaker1 : What do you do in a heart surgery? Is that you stabilize the heart.
speaker2 : Yeah. So after putting the patient to sleep. Right, you would take artery from the inside of the chest, called a left internal mammary, or right internal mammary, which you leave intact up here, and you clip the end of it. And normally that works with the intercostal arteries to basically provide blood flow to your ribs and to the tissue in between. And it won't miss it because you have collateral or other circulation to that area. And then you also take veins from the leg called the greater saphenous vein, which is a superficial vein that's easily accessed. Or you can take radial arteries from the hand, which are small arteries, your hand, and you have two arteries in your hand, the radial and the ulnar artery. And if you take the radial artery, so long as you've done your testing to make sure that the flow is okay with just the ulnar, it can work as a conduit. A conduit meaning a pipe, basically. So in the case of the mammaries, this is intact, and now the patient's asleep, you've opened up their chest, you put the heart on a retractor, and then there's two ways you can do it. In one case, if you can do it off pump, what it means is you don't arrest the heart, you don't stop it. Instead, what you do is you position the patient in a way that the blood flow is not compromised, and you put a suction retractor on it, called an octopus or whichever brand you use, and it basically picks up and shows you the artery. And then what you do is you cut a small hole in the artery. And the nice thing with the coronary arteries is they're all on the outside of the heart, unlike, you know, the big arteries, which are pumping the flow to the heart is actually on the outside of the heart. They made it convenient so that we could access if we needed to. Right. And so we open up the artery, and we put in either a flow stent, which is a small, temporary pipe, so that blood goes beyond, and then we bypass that area. And as we finish the bypass, we pull that out. And generally, if you're using the mammary, the flow is going to be on right away because we just put a temporary clip on it, a little alligator clip, and then once we're done with that, we deair it, and then we turn on the blood flow again with the. With the veins from the legs or the radial artery. Oftentimes we will hook it up to the aorta first and then measure it out the distance because it stretches and it has to be exactly right to, you know, bridge the gap. And then we do the same thing and reposition. Are there places where it's hard to do it? Yeah, on the back of the heart. It's really challenging because you have to twist it around and there, sometimes you have to go on pump, but there's a huge art to it. And that wasn't the only thing we did as heart surgeons. We replaced valves, did a lot of aortic surgery. Surgery both open and endovascular. We did robotic surgery. I could do a one vessel through the robot through a minimal incision. So we did minimally invasive stuff. We also did lung surgery. So a lot of things going on with heart surgery, and it's advanced a lot. But, you know, at the end of the day, my thought was two, three patients a day. I would say if we can prevent early recognized, early treat, we're going to be at a much better likelihood of saving lives. And it doesn't mean that the number of heart surgeries will go down. In fact, it may actually go up because we're recognizing it earlier. It's just that people won't have complications and long term, they'll have better lives and lifestyles. So is that enough? Whoa.
speaker1 : Okay, summarize. Heart surgery. Surgery. They see some part of the heart is damaged. If it's a pipe, you replace it with a pipe from another part of the body.
speaker2 : Yeah. And not damage. The damage comes once the pipes blocked. Blocked, yeah. And so the idea is you got to get blood flow back. But now, if it's narrow and for all intents purposes, when you work out, you're getting chest pain, I need to give you better blood flow. If it's in three vessels or it's in the left or it's in an area they can't stent, you would bypass it or in a diabetic. In other cases, you could stent them, knowing that with heart surgery, it's usually more durable, meaning in a ten year period, less likelihood of having another intervention. But nothing lasts forever. So with all of that, we have to manage. And so that comes under the category of secondary prevention we're talking about. Right. Primary prevention is sort of out, meaning that just because you have high cholesterol, I'm not going to dump a bunch of drugs into you, but if you have risk factors for disease, like a first degree relative, all that that is a person I would intervene with. Secondary prevention is after you've had the heart attack, I already know you've got the cholesterol, and I need to prevent you from having another artery and for these arteries to stay open. So in that patient, you are going to maximally reduce cholesterol and do all the other interventions, put them on a cardiac rehab protocol, get them to respect their bodies, no smoking. Be very smart about how you live, what you eat, and try to de stress. And if you can manage those risk factors, the long term is very bright. Knowing that this disease is in cities, it's a lifetime thing. We need to take it from an acute occurrence to a chronic that we treat for a lifetime. And with that, people do live very, very. That wasn't what it was meant to be. In fact, it was supposed to put you in a position of power. Knowledge is power. If you know about it, you'll be able to sit there and prevent it. Right. And the idea is to intervene early and often before you get into trouble. That's the whole mission now. Okay.
speaker1 : Um. The thing is, I want to take the conversation into a slightly uncomfortable place.
speaker2 : Sure.
speaker1 : So I'm really, really trying to help you separate your own emotions from this next segment. But, you know, you spoke about the 0.01% cases where you end up blaming yourself, but then you realize that lifestyle has also been a factor in those cases, what happens on the surgery table with patients who don't make it.
speaker2 : So, you know, going into these cases, you try to give patients and their families very realistic expectations, and the window dressing has to be appropriate. In addition to that, we would call out to the recovery room and talk to the patients during the. And my nurses would, obviously I wouldn't, but we would tell them how things are going. In the case where we knew this patient was at imminent risk, if I did nothing, you knew they would die. If I did something, there was a risk, you would be straightforward with them. And then in those situations where they did not make it through, my first and foremost responsibility was to that family to make sure that they got the grief counseling they needed, and we would talk to them as if it was their own family. Right.
speaker1 : But what were those patients realities that their heart reached that stage?
speaker2 : Sure. So in many cases, they came in late. Right. And the window of opportunity is if the heart attack is within the first 6 hours. Right. And you can bypass them, you're not going to get as many issues with cell death. And Morgan, from six to 24 hours is kind of this precarious period. And then beyond that, if they survive coming into you, you could wait it out for a while until the heart stabilizes and bypass. So there was a little bit of kind of darwinian Darwin theory here, that survival of the fittest. The tricky part was when someone has abused themselves for years and years and years through bad living, right? I mean, they knew they had risk factors for heart disease. They basically, and to be honest, let's be clear about this. Even when, you know, sometimes you have no choices to make. Either you don't have the ability to eat what you need to eat because you don't have enough money, right. Or alternatively, you are so driven in your career or other things that you come upon a lot of variables which are unfortunate. Right. And in those situations, what can you say? You do the best you can. So I always was the patience advocate, and I said, look, we'll do everything. You know, sometimes you have to play the cards you're dealt, right? Your genetics are bad, you have a history of diabetes, you're a smoker, you are morbidly obese. All those are risk factors you knew going into it, right. And you sometimes lose focus. And the idea is that as a society, we come together, not just raise awareness, but between us, we say to each other, look, I'm gonna take care of you, you take care of me, and we don't be your mother, your wife, your girlfriend, you know, and keep chiding people. In fact, my wife is great about this. I'm like the worst enemy and she doesn't give me heart. Done. But the issue is that we gently kind of reinforce our habits and lives. So then fast forwarding. We do that, we avoid these situations. But in the cases where all of these were predicted variables, we knew what the risk was. And then there was also end organ damage. There were arrests where people were found down and their chests were thumped on and they were able to get a rhythm back, but the guy had no brain function. Then you had to decide, do you operate on something? And you would want to see that their brain came back, because remember that it's down from over six minutes. You may have permanent loss of brain. And so even if you get the heart back and it's pumping, the patient will always be comatose. And there it doesn't make things. So the decision points we had were incredible. You played God sometimes, and it was tough, right? And the bottom line is that you did the best you could with what you had. And 99.9% percent of the time it worked. In that 0.1%, you were devastated because you poured your whole heart and soul and left everything on the field to try to save someone, and you knew that you had done everything right, didn't make it easier. And when you wake up at nighttime in cold sweats, it ain't the 9999 cases you did perfect. It's that one case which didn't turn out well, which had nothing to do with you. You did the same thing that you always did, but you still felt bad for that family, right? And so, you know, it's a tough job, and I'm not the only one who's faced this. I'm sure a lot of doctors have. I mean, in the. We were seeing suicide at an incredible rate in caregivers. And I talked about this on the channel with burnout and things like that. It happens in the armed forces, it happens. Happens in the police, it happens in firefighters. It happens in a lot of professions, right? And the idea is we need to support each other mentally when stuff like that happens and keep talking to each other and vent, right? And say, look, we did everything and it still didn't happen the way we were. And, you know, we face this in our lives, you and I and everyone do that, you're gonna have successes and I failures, and you've got to be able to, you know, be cognizant of the fact that sometimes everything you do it still may not turn out exactly what you do. And it may not be something like heart search. It might be something, you know, like a business deal or, I don't know about you, but with me, a vlog. Sometimes your vlogs don't go as planned. You don't get the views, right? And that doesn't sound like a catastrophic nightmare, but it is when you pour your heart and soul into it, right.
speaker1 : When you see hearts like that, as a cardiac surgeon opening up someone's chest, that heart is beating, especially hearts of people who have not taken care of their bodies over so many years, how does it change your relationship with the lifestyle factors, like smoking, alcohol?
speaker2 : It's pretty obvious. You realize very clearly that these are a thing, right? Whether you realize it or not, your body is not a black box. And I can show you lots of evidence to suggest that if you abuse for a longer period of time, right, and have a bad medical history or a bad genetic history, you will have to pay for that.
speaker1 : Do you have anything to say about meat? Because it's one of those. I mean, we're living in an age where there are extreme views on both ends, right? The one thing I've got to know through the show, through talking to healthcare professionals, coaches, etcetera, is that everyone's bodies are slightly different. So there's no one diet that suits everyone. But when it comes to heart disease, I often hear people talking about red meat especially.
speaker2 : Yeah.
speaker1 : So, as a cardiac surgeon, where do you stand on red meat? And where do you stand on meat in general? And I have no strong preconceived notions. I've been a non vegetarian all my life. Turned vegetarian five years ago. It suits me. Does that mean I recommend vegetarianism to everyone? I don't know.
speaker2 : So, you know, it's very interesting you should ask. We kind of had a small conversation before this. But first off, I wouldn't ask anyone to do anything just because of me. Look at the data, right, and in the wrong genetic pool, in the wrong patient. Do eating more of something with high cholesterol, high fat, whatnot, meaning people with primary risk factors. You will be at risk. Right now, the question comes in meat in general. So I am non veg, as you know, but all of my relatives from two generations ago were all bad. My grandma would throw the pan out if you had an egg fried. And, you know, they grew up in coconut. And the usual suspects, the Brahmin, whatever. And the interesting part is, it doesn't matter how you perceive that. I think for me personally, I've seen a lot of documentaries on this. I've looked at the data, and some part of me wants to become vegan for other reasons. One is sustainability. Right. Animal agriculture has a very high toll on the planet. We're already talking about, you know, greenhouse gases and lack of the ozone. And, you know, if you've seen some of the documentaries, you know, 600 liters of water being consumed. Water is a precious commodity. But the second and third reasons are very clear. The second one is, I'm an animal lab, and so I have joined hands with various groups to support these things. I've adopted a lot of strays, and, you know, I don't like how the animals are treated, whether they're free range or not. If you can support live on no meat and still persist, why wouldn't you? The third reason is, from a health perspective, the animal fats are more injurious than the vegetable born things. Let me put this in context, though. If you have a genetic makeup where you are depositing fat and have a abnormal lipid metabolism, which is the case for the subcontinent, it is, for the most part, then even being veg doesn't matter, right. If you have morbid obesity, diabetes, all these other risk factors, it doesn't matter if you're veg or non veg, you're still gonna have risk for heart disease. So I don't think it's as clear that one versus the other, but for the other several reasons which we've quoted, I I do think it's beneficial. And then the last thing is just the feel good factor, right? I'm lactose intolerant, so milk products can't drink and without getting bloating and all the other issues. And that, by the way, genetically, they consider 85% of non whites to be, to some degree, lactose intolerant, whether they know it or not. They may have the bloating, feel like they have to go to the bathroom, burping, stomach upset, whatnot, and not attribute it to lactose, but they probably haven't, whereas, and it's thought to be there because we have a lot of sunlight to convert vitamin d three. So after childhood, you don't really need milk to supplement for vitamin d three, whereas in the nordic countries, where there's less sun and the winters are longer, and you need the milk throughout your life. And so in Caucasians, oftentimes they won't have it, 85% will be non lactose intolerant, 15% of the lactose. So that's an interesting aside, but the point is, I wouldn't miss that part, the meat and all that. So I'm exploring now, just between you and me, and I think India is one place where the vet is so doggone good. 110%. I'll tell you, my folks immigrated from here to London in 63, and then from London to the US in 73. I was born in London, but it was very hard in those days to be strict veg. People did it, but kind of ostracized you. And that's not an excuse. But the point is that we grew up eating meat, right? And now, moving back to India, I would be very happy with pure veg, because the food is so darn, darn good here. Whether you go north, south, east, west, it's amazing, right? And so I don't think there would be any qualms in my life, and I think I could do it. And then the last thing, I have a lot of friends who own these companies that make synthetic meat, right? Either it's actually manufactured from proteins, or the alternative is its meat lookalikes. I'm like, why do you have to do that? The veg is so doggone good that you really don't need to have the meat, but I think it's for the people who eat meat who need that kind of handholding period, to make the progression. And so I do think as a planet, we'd probably be healthier for various reasons, which, if I outline. But am I proposing that you push on? No, I'm not.
speaker1 : The reason I'm listening to you very keenly about this answer is because everything you speak is data driven.
speaker2 : Yep. I try to make it, but. But honestly, I mean, there's gonna be people who are gonna fight me on this because they're meat eaters. And even the red meat stuff with colonic cancer and other things, particularly the cured meats, which have nitrites and things in them, there is some data which suggests that the incidence is higher. What's not clear to me, if you look in the european countries, the western countries like London or the US, the colon cancer rates are much higher. But some of that may be because they're eating much more meat, because their vegetable growing cycle is low, or it used to be, now it's changed, right? They import everything, but their lifestyle or habits of may be that they eat more meat and less veggies. The other thing for me, and I'll be very candid with you, that I'm, you know, if not bodybuilding, at least staying in massive shape. And the only struggle for me is getting enough protein and how much dal can you eat before you get gassy and have other issues? But that's a separate issue, that the main thing is I can't eat paneer. And so because of milk products. And so I struggle with that. And that's the one thing I'm trying to overcome and figure out how to do it without compromising. But I don't know, long term, you grow out of it as you get older. It's whatever. Maybe I'm not Arnold Schwarzenegger. I shouldn't have never been. And maybe just be a little more ripped and lean. And because I was a cross country runner for most of my life, or playing tennis and in taekwondo, you needed that muscle mass to win.
speaker1 : From a heart disease perspective. Perspective. There is no data driven guideline that.
speaker2 : Says veg alone will do it. Well. I mean, look at the data, right? I mean, heart disease is rampant all across India, and it is not univariate variable, it's multivariable. And so if we understand that, let me give you an example. If you're eating lean meat, right, and you're not consuming it in large portions, and your cholesterol and all the other variables are managed, and you don't have diabetes, why would you have a much higher rate? The cancer risk is different. And that's for, you know, nitrosamine, nitrites from cured meat and things like that, and also from lack of vegetables. We don't see as high a rate in India, mainly because we eat a lot of veg. You know, there's a lot of fiber in our diet, but versus someone who is a vegetarian and eats just about anything under the sun and with a lot of oil and other things, I think you could have an equally dangerous lifespan. So I think what it comes down to is your risk factors and monitoring and mitigating those. But to say one is better than the other, I. I do it for those reasons I've alluded to. But to tell someone who's eating meat, if you're doing it in reasonable fashion and this is what you enjoy, feel free. So long as your risk factors are managed, right.
speaker1 : If you take care about how your body looks visually, that doesn't mean you need to be ripped. You just need to look like Doctor Nene.
speaker2 : Ah, thank you.
speaker1 : Like, your stomach is flat, your shoulders.
speaker2 : Are broad, you look at always. I tell you that much. I mean, it went through phases. It was when I was 20, in about somewhere between 35 and 45, I started getting 49 year old paunch. Really? Yeah. Yeah. And then I'll show you some pictures that will blow your mind.
speaker1 : When I look at you right now, I feel like you've really taken care of yourself.
speaker2 : I'm doing better. But the thing is, I'm the first to tell you it takes no time to gain weight and takes forever to lose it. And honestly, it's about discipline. My wife is so much more disciplined because she's in front of the camera all the time. For me, I'm only now in front of the camera. But the thing is, I love to live, right? I love to experience. And so what that means to me is that I have to do it in very careful amounts. Right? Don't overeat, you know, limit I or eliminate your alcohol intake. Be sensible about your sleep. Make sure you drink enough water. And then make sure that your mind is always focused and mindful. Meditate. And I've talked about this on the channel and other things. And I just think if you start to do that on a qualified basis, you'll have a better life.
speaker1 : Are you happier in India than you were in America?
speaker2 : I can't say happier. It was different, right? I mean, there you got your anonymity, you got your independence, and a lot of it was self driven. In India, I have a culture. We have a lot of ties. And so it's different.
speaker1 : Right? And you're married to Madhuri de ki.
speaker2 : Well, I mean, that was always the case whether I was in the US or here.
speaker1 : How do you feel about that pro level? How do you feel about that?
speaker2 : I don't know her like that, you know, I mean, she's my wife and my partner. And my encouragement to people is be what you always want them to be and support the people with you. And we're partners in a marriage where we look after each other, you know, forever. And if you develop that type of relationship, it doesn't matter what they did. I never knew her past history and she never knew mine. And we came from very different worlds, yet similar. We're from the same sort of sub region, Maharashtra. We're the same kind of language, same kind of background. Neither of us thought this would happen, but it did. Kismet fate. But I will tell you, it's been, you know, the most amazing thing in my life. And I would say that if you can find a partner who aligns and is your soulmate, there's nothing like it. And it doesn't matter if they're. They're what they do for a living. I mean, I think so many people have done so many things, you yourself included, all these guys here that you show respect. But what matters is the relationship at the end of the day and the fun you have together. And, you know, it's challenging. I mean, the challenges we have are different. But I was in LA and we took care of a lot of the industry there and the main challenge was anonymity. They just wanted to put their pants on one leg at a time and behave like normal people. The lucky thing is we both enjoy that. Less so in India to some degree. But we're very grateful for everything, for the people. And obviously she. She's so down to earth and the way she treats everyone, including her fans and everyone. And same with me, that both of us are very respectful. There's no sir in our house or in our office. And we try to be good people and that should be kind of the mantra for all of us that'll be leading to a better society. Certainly the kids have adopted it, which I'm charmed by, to bet these guys are really good guys. And so I think we've succeeded the subdivision. It's hard to know. I mean, I'd love to fast forward 2030 years and see where they end up, but so far I've been enamored with their progress and not an easy subject, trust me, parenting is hard.
speaker1 : Weird question, but does a good marriage add to physical health?
speaker2 : Yes, 100%. So stress is one thing, right? But having not just a marriage but a family, there's really good evidence that loneliness has a higher risk of death. In fact, they've amounted loneliness to smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Damn. In terms of lifespans. There's a study on this and the interesting part is that loneliness does have detrimental effects on your life. So if we broaden the sense whether it's a good marriage or it's a good relationship or a good family, that saves you. And there's been numerous studies, some of them described in the literature, some ted, some at other places. But if you look in Italy, for instance, there was one town which had a very high longevity. And there was nothing special about their genes when they studied it. But what was special was the social structure. Everyone talked amongst the each other. They all supported each other when things were down. I think we have that unique quality in India. The only problem in India is that you know how we live in this town, right? It's a mile a minute and you're always struggling to do stuff, particularly right now. We're in a transition phase. Right. I think there's even more fundamental things. 270 million people don't get enough to eat, right. There's fundamental things which we're struggling with in India, which I think we can do better and fix, and the government's working on that. There's some great progress. But I'm saying that even the bigger ticket items, right, if we can just take an hour a day, even a minute a day, and just focus on relationships and on building and on complementing and on improving things, the world gets to be better.
speaker1 : Doctor Nene, I could speak to you for now.
speaker2 : I feel the same way. We had a lot of fun together.
speaker1 : Thank you. I feel this was just the introduction to your body of work to at least our audience, I won't say the indian Internet, because you have a booming YouTube channel yourself. Is there any signing of note you have for everyone who's gotten a little almost scared after this conversation?
speaker2 : No. So don't be afraid. I'm here all for you and for everyone else. The idea is knowledge is power. And if we can identify stuff in your life which makes a difference and intervene before it causes an issue, it would be much more powerful than if you treat medicine as a rotating door where you only go when you're sick. And it all comes down to healthcare and well care versus sick care, right? So the. The message is clear that I'm with you. I want you with me for 100 years. And I'm here to help you never ever to sit here and judge or to do any of that, because life is a journey and it needs to be lived and walked with everyone holding hands, not individually.
speaker1 : Looking forward to speaking with you again. Thank you for your time.
speaker2 : My pleasure. Appreciate it. Thank you so much. Lots of fun. See you.
speaker1 : So, ladies and gentlemen, that was the episode for today. But trust me, you've just gotten to know Doctor Sriram Nene from a very different perspective. Make sure you check out his YouTube channel as well. What I really wish to say about him, other than the stuff that we've already spoken about on the show, is that there's something called type A personalities, right? You know, when you're growing up in, in school, that kid who's great at studies, but also is fantastic at sports, is great at co curricular activities, that's a type a personality. Or in the professional world, the professionals who just keep going for the best of the best game, you know, the highest performers, those are type A personalities in my eyes. Doctor Nene is a type A personality. He's a serial achiever. He chases excellence, which is why this podcast was so thrilling for me. It was so much fun. He's going to be back on TRS. I can't wait to speak to him again. I'd love for you guys to comment down below. Tell me what else you'd like for Doctor Nene to speak about. Because he's not just a doctor, he's actually had a bit of a career switch and he's a very active investor. He's very active in the world of business now. Very, very humble human being, but doesn't talk about the level of success that he's achieved. I'm looking forward to bringing him back on the show. Until then, make sure you check out his YouTube channel. And until the next time, remember to keep supporting TRS. Lots of knowledge is yet to be shared because true happiness is only gained through true curiosity. It's happened through curiosity on the Renv show. Gonna be back thanks to sport.
speaker2 : Lots of love for you guys. Boom. Shut.
