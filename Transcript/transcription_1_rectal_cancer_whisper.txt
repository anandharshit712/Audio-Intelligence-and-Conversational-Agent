 Welcome back to another episode of the Oncology Brothers podcast. I am Rahul Ghasain, joined as always by my co-host and brother, Rohit Ghasain. So far in our GI series, we've covered HCC, colon cancer, liver-directed therapies, and understanding the needs of different patient populations with colorectal cancer. Today, we're going to shift the focus on rectal cancer, particularly localized or locally advanced disease. While locally advanced cases require an aggressive multimodality approach to maximize the chances of cure, we must also be cognizant of the potential long-term complications associated with our treatments. Absolutely, Rahul. The key challenge in managing locally advanced rectal cancer is achieving that perfect balance between therapeutic efficacy and limiting the chronic side effects. To dive deeper into our current strategies, you're joined by Dr. Deb Schrag, a medical oncologist, from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and Dr. Christian Jetwa, a radiation oncologist from the Mayo Clinic. Deb and Krish, welcome. Thank you. It's nice to be here. Likewise. Thanks so much for the invitation. Perfect. Thanks so much again for joining us. Deb, last year, just around this time, can't believe it's about a year already, you presented PROSPECT study as one of the ASCO plenary discussions. Before we talk about this algorithm, to lay the foundation, let's just talk a bit about PROSPECT study. Rectal cancer is a multidisciplinary approach where we know that patients need systemic therapy, radiation, and surgery. PROSPECT study focused on a limited patient population where radiation could be avoided, mainly to limit chronic side effects. What did the study generally show, and how are you utilizing this study in your practice today? Yeah. So first, I would say it wasn't such a limited patient population. So we, we excluded patients who needed APRs, abdominal perineal resections, which are patients with distal disease. And we excluded patients who had really bulky tumors, like T4 tumors and four lymph nodes over a centimeter. But the majority of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer actually were PROSPECT eligible. So it was not such a limited subset. It's also not such a low risk subset. A lot of the patients had node positive disease. So I would say, PROSPECT patients are pretty typical garden variety rectal cancer patients. Look, since 1990, curing rectal cancer has involved three modalities, surgery, chemo radiation, and chemotherapy. And we've been playing this three card Monte of moving the order around. Okay. But essentially for 30 years, we've been playing with each of those three modalities and just rearranging the sequencing. And, you know, maybe we could do K-POP, maybe we could do capecitabine instead of IV5FU, but that's it. What PROSPECT did is say, could we, now that we've had all these amazing therapeutic advances and diagnostic advances, we've got MRIs, so we can stage better. We're doing screening colonoscopy. So we're finding smaller tumors. We have FOLFOX rather than just plain old 5FU, which is what we had in 2002. All these advances combined. Can we trim our sales a little bit, as you said, to make it easier to get through treatment? And that was what PROSPECT was trying to do. So we basically did this big randomized trial where we compared the tried and true method since 1990 with a selective method where we said, if your tumor melts to FOLFOX, we're not going to give you chemo radiation. And the bottom line is that outcomes were identical. It, the trial met its non-inferiority endpoint. So if you meet your endpoint in a non-inferiority and there's no oxygen between the survival curves, not between the disease-free survival curves, not between the overall survival curves and the quality of life favors, not giving chemo radiation, then, you know, you can give patients the choice and let them vote with their feet. And I think that is the right answer. Give patients a choice. So, you know, I say, look, if I have a violin player, and they just can't have any oxaliplatin, go with a chemo radiation. But most people who don't have neuropathy or contraindication to oxaliplatin choose to avoid the chemo radiation because it has long-term consequences. We know it impairs bowel sexual function, second malignancies in the radiation field. One that I think is often overlooked has to do with if you're unlucky enough to have your cancer come back, if you've had radiation, radiation to the pelvis, you have less stamina to withstand metastatic therapy when we give it in the metastatic year setting. But again, we cured 80% of these folks. So hopefully that's not too many people. You know, when we have options for patients, that's just a win. So Prospect is a win because it says that we can cure, you got a good chance of being cured with two modalities, not one. Not three. The outcomes were identical with an quality of life edge for the strategy that eliminated chemo radiation. Deb, thank you for going over that and congratulations on this tremendous effort. Like you've pointed out, this is not a small patient population. A lot of our patients with locally advanced rectal cancer, we have to keep this in mind. Deb, this was a study that enrolled patients during, 2012 to 2018. And at least during that time and now when comparing to 2024, our systemic treatments have not changed much. But one can argue that radiation modalities have improved in this period. Right now, majority of our patients coming in the office, we have to entertain this versus total neoadjuvant treatment. In the community settings, we have to be mindful to ensure that we can omit radiation in the right patient population, but also understand, the right current available radiation treatments. Krish, this brings up the point on this evolving paradigm of radiation. How do you decide on the radiation course for the patient in front of you? Yeah, I think that's a great question. I'd also like to piggyback on some of the comments that Deb made. I think it's a, the PROSPECT study was truly a tremendous study. And I think it's really broadened our perspective on the overall care of our patients with rectal cancer. So, I think one of the beautiful concepts that I think has really evolved since the trial was presented and we've discussed it, is that it's really emphasized this balance between quality of life and cancer control for our patients. And I think it's become an even more kind of predominant concept amongst our discussions. I'm also a believer very much like Deb is that we can use MRI based risk stratification and these contemporary trial data to really direct patients to an approach that may optimize that balance between quality of life and cancer control. And, sometimes, often, it could be selective emission of radiation therapy for candidates, just like for those that were included in PROSPECT, which I also would agree over kind of that standard risk cohort, garden variety cohort of patients with rectal cancer, or in patients that have more mid or distal tumors in whom we could potentially better spare function and quality of life with a selective organ preserving approach. We could use chemo radiation and consolidated chemotherapy and selectively omit surgery in those that have a cancer. And, selectively omit surgery in those that have a cancer. And, selectively omit surgery in those that have a cancer. And, selectively omit surgery in those that have a cancer. And, we could also have a complete response. So, at least from a radiation therapy perspective, there really two predominant regimens that are used in the care of patients at short course radiation therapy, or long course chemo radiation. Randomized trials in general suggest that each of those two approaches are relatively equivalent in regards to oncologic outcome. But we do know from a large volume of data that MRI based risk stratification can really guide us towards patients that may be at higher risk stratification than those that are at higher risk stratification. And, at higher risk of pelvic recurrence versus distant recurrence. And in addition to that, the RAPIDO trial has provided some suggestion that patients with essentially high-risk rectal cancer may be at a higher risk of pelvic recurrence if treated with a short-course TNT paradigm compared with long-course chemoradiation. So at least in my practice, if I am considering the use of radiation therapy, I'm often very supportive of short-course radiation therapy platform. But in patients with high-risk rectal cancer, specifically high-risk of pelvic recurrence, which I think of as clinical T4B, compromised mesorectal fascia, involved lateral pelvic lymph nodes, or distal tumors approximating the anal verge, I tend to favor long-course chemoradiation in that subset of patients. Thanks so much for covering that, Chris. And of course, we have to appreciate that none of this is black and white situation. It's always multidisciplinary approach, and a lot of discussion takes place before one decides the treatment course. Deb, just to make the matters a bit more complicated, which chemo arm that you utilize in general? Is it Folfox or Kapox-based, which is what RAPIDO and STELLAR studies have shown, or Folfirinox in some patient population, which is by Prodigy? Yeah. So for high-risk patients, so patients with T4 or N2 were very high, absolutely Folfirinox intensification makes sense. But for patients with atypical locally advanced rectal cancer, and by typical, I mean mid-rectum, clinically node-positive, but not big bulky nodes, not encroaching up on the pelvic side wall, Folfox is fine. Folfox and Kapox, I consider to be interchangeable, if I have concerns about compliance or adherence, it's not really compliance, it's medication adherence, I think Folfox is more strategic, and that tends to be what I use. But we really have voluminous data that keeps cytobine taken appropriately and 5-FU intravenously are interchangeable. So Kapox and Folfox are interchangeable. So I think that that works. With respect to your question, and the first thing is to determine whether an individual is MSI high. If someone's MSI high, and we didn't know this when we started Prospect, we figured this out, but it took a while. First, figure out who's MSI high. That's a small group of people, maybe 5%, maybe as high as 8%, but it's small. If you're MSI high, go get your immunotherapy, because we may be able to cure you not with two modalities, but with one modality. It's like even, it's the dream, okay? So that's first. If you're MSI high, go get your immunotherapy, and hopefully you're done. If you're not MSI high, and you're intermediate risk, it's a choice, but more and more patients are opting to avoid the long-term risk. So if you're MSI high, go get your immunotherapy, and hopefully you're done. If you're MSI high, go get your immunotherapy, and hopefully you're done. sequelae of chemo radiation. However, if you have a distal tumor, and you're going to require an APR, or you have a distal tumor, and you would require a low resection with a coloanal anastomosis, and you're going to be left running to the bathroom, then I think chemoradiation is the way to go with a total neoadjuvant therapy approach. So if it's a low tumor, go TNT. If you're going to need a coloanal or a really low anastomosis that's going to mess up your quality of life, go with TNT. So I don't know, if you just want to take centimeters, understanding that everyone's anatomy is a little bit different. If you have a tumor that's going to require an APR and let's say is below four centimeters, go TNT. I think if you're in the four to five centimeter range, it probably also makes sense to consider TNT. Because the anastomosis is going to be pretty low, even if it's an LAR. I think if you're above five centimeters, you got a choice. Because again, Prospect showed us that the outcomes are identical. But the edge for quality of life, I'd go chemotherapy only. And remember, in Prospect, if you didn't have a great response to chemotherapy, you had a second chance. You could then get chemoradiation, which is essentially TNT. So I would do chemo first for sort of those intermediate risk above five centimeter folks. And I also want to put in a plug for surgery first. We got some people whose tumors are right at the junction. They're basically sigmoid tumors. Sometimes it's okay to take those people straight to the operating room. Sometimes they don't have any nodes and you can be done. So. It's really about, it's become a sorting game. Who can have just immunotherapy? Who can have just surgery? Who can have TNT and then no surgery? And who needs everything? A few people still need all three modalities and everything. But this is really about application of our existing technologies and just sorting people to get what they need, but not what they don't need. And dynamic approach. So we're looking at different approaches that use the responses to tailor treatment. Absolutely. Again, we've seen this recurrent theme that more is not always good. And that is what we're trying to figure out. Can we get away with one or two modalities rather than sticking with our old paradigm of triplet? The other thing I want to bring up from ASCO 2023, of course, Prospect was presented there as a plenary discussion. Deb, you mentioned Cape Ox when using Cape Cytabine with hand foot syndrome. Another study from ASCO 2023 was Diclofenib. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's a synesthetic solution called Diclofenib. It's not a plug in the oven or on the internet. It's a pog Q것 test. It was very likely to praying than getting paired at the same time. That definitely applies to diethylamide. shape of future rectal cancer practice is really going to be based upon this concept that we're trying to think of a single local treatment modality for the vast majority of patients, such that we can better preserve function and quality of life. At least in our multidisciplinary clinic, we've taken the approach that if patients have tumors within five centimeters of the anal sphincter complex, so not anal verge, but within five centimeters of the top of sphincter complex, those are patients that we're increasingly considering a total new adjuvant therapy approach and selective omission of surgery if they have a complete clinical response to therapy. And that's for the same reasons that Deb just mentioned, that having patients that have a low tumor that has a low anastomosis is associated with very significant bowel dysfunction after an operation. But in addition to that, any operation inside of the pelvis is also associated with significant bladder and sexual dysfunction. And sometimes that function can better be preserved with a single local treatment modality, whether it's chemo radiation or surgery. But the combination of both chemo radiation plus surgery is without a doubt worse than either one or the other. So at least in our practice, we're very comfortable with proceeding per essentially the OPRA study with giving long course chemo radiation followed by consolidated Folfax-based systemic therapy, or in those that have very high risk tumors. If we are still considering organ preservation, we will often intensify with the use of Folfurinox. And we tend to obtain response assessment around eight weeks after completion of chemotherapy. That's also a little bit debatable, but I think anywhere in that range of four to 12 weeks would be reasonable. And then just like many others, we follow the MSK direction of response assessment per MRI, digital exam, and endoscopy. And if there's a complete response, then we're very comfortable proceeding with an active surveillance approach. I think we're all having challenges with that near complete response group, because just like the OPRA study has taught us, we're seeing very discrete differences in outcomes between those that have an initial complete response versus near complete versus incomplete response. And while OPRA did allow near complete responders to continue to be surveyed, and if they either stayed stable or converted to a complete response, they were able to continue along that pathway. I think the recent update has at least given us some pause that disease-free survival outcomes may be poorer in that group. I'm still comfortable if a patient has a near complete response at that first response assessment with performing in another close response assessment about eight weeks later or so. And if they have a complete response at that point, and they're well informed on the potential risks, still proceeding with an active surveillance approach. But Deb, I'm curious, how have you all or have you all changed your practice based upon your more recent update of the OPRA study? Yeah, I mean, I think that we continue to tailor. I think interpretation of the OPRA study is controversial. Remember, this was a randomized phase two, not a phase three. It wasn't, you know, it's been interpreted as though it were a phase three, but it actually wasn't. So, yeah, I think that there are different perspectives on how meaningful the differences in outcome in OPRA are and whether that sequencing is essential or not. I think there are a good number of physicians who continue to think that whichever modality you can start the most quickly is the best one to get the patient some relief. Thank you so much for covering that question, Deb. And well, this talk would not be complete if we don't stress the importance of MSM. I think that's a really important point. I think that's a really important point. I think that's a really important point. I think that's a really important point. I think that's a really important point. As you mentioned, Deb, it was your colleagues from MSK who published this data about two years ago. Yes. And what a significant improvement in quality of life and decreasing the modality use of surgery and radiation, especially when they have complete response. So, congratulations to you. Yeah, I would just say that we have even more data now. That study only included around 16 patients, but now we have more than double, triple that. Exactly. And essentially the response rate is 100 percent and it's been validated by centers around the country and around the world. We figured out the biology and we know what to do and it's a win for our patients, which is great for everybody. Indeed. It's a small population, but it is very important to test for MSI high before proceeding with any modality to see if they would qualify for single immune checkpoint inhibitors. Deb and Krish, thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us today. It's a pleasure. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for taking the time to be with us. Krish, thank you so much for taking the time to cover this very important topic and discussing our current available treatment options for locally advanced rectal cancers. For our listeners, stay tuned for a short recap. With the increasing incidence of rectal cancer, we need to get comfortable in appreciating the nuances of treating locally advanced rectal cancer. In this discussion with Dr. Deborah Schrag, a medical oncologist from Memorial Sloan Kettering, and Dr. Christian Jethwa, a radiation oncologist from Mayo Clinic, we had a chance to focus on our current available options. Based off prospect trial, a plenary discussion at ASCO 2023, we can potentially omit radiation in the right patient population for rectal cancer. We also need to be mindful of organ preservation with selective omission of surgery in the right patient. However, with improving radiation modalities, total neoadjuvant treatment still remains a viable option for the right locally advanced rectal cancer patients. Selecting the right patient for short course versus long course radiation based on their risk of recurrence is extremely important. Another critical aspect is testing for MSI high status, as these patients can have a great response to a single agent immune checkpoint inhibitors. Thank you for joining us.
